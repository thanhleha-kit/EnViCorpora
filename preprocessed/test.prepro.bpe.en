when I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called " No@@ thing T@@ o en@@ vy . "
and I was very proud .
in school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim I@@ l-@@ S@@ ung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the ene@@ mi@@ es .
although I often wonder@@ ed about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
when I was seven years old , I saw my first public execu@@ tion , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hu@@ nger .
but one day , in 199@@ 5 , my mom brought home a letter from a co@@ wor@@ ker 's sister .
it read , " Wh@@ en you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we have not e@@ aten for the past two weeks .
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so wea@@ k we are ready to die . "
I was so sho@@ cked .
this was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can ' t er@@ ase from my memory .
a life@@ less woman was lying on the ground , while an em@@ aci@@ ated child in her arms just star@@ ed hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ly at his mother 's face .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
a huge fa@@ mine hit North Korea in the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s .
ultimately , more than a million North Kore@@ ans died during the fa@@ mine , and many only survi@@ ved by eating gra@@ ss , bu@@ gs and tree bar@@ k .
power ou@@ ta@@ ges also became more and more frequ@@ ent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wonder@@ ed why they had lights but we did not .
this is a satelli@@ te picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighb@@ ors .
this is the Am@@ ro@@ k Ri@@ ver , which ser@@ ves as a part of the bor@@ der between North Korea and China .
as you can see , the river can be very nar@@ row at certain points , al@@ lowing North Kore@@ ans to secre@@ tly cross .
but many die .
sometimes , I saw dead bodies flo@@ ating down the river .
I can ' t reve@@ al many details [ about ] how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the u@@ g@@ ly years of the fa@@ mine I was sent to China to live with di@@ stant rela@@ tives .
but I only thought that I would be separ@@ ated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imag@@ ined that it would take 14 years to live together .
in China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Kore@@ an refu@@ ge@@ e , but I soon learned it 's not only extremely difficult , it 's also very dangerous , since North Kore@@ an refu@@ ge@@ es are considered in China as il@@ legal mi@@ gr@@ ants .
so I was living in constant fear that my identity could be reve@@ aled , and I would be re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated to a horri@@ ble f@@ ate back in North Korea .
one day , my worst ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for inter@@ ro@@ gation .
someone had accu@@ sed me of being North Kore@@ an , so they te@@ sted my Chinese language a@@ bilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de .
if anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
after they finished ques@@ tion@@ ing me , one official said to another , " This was a fal@@ se report .
she 's not North Kore@@ an . "
and they let me go . it was a mi@@ rac@@ le .
some North Kore@@ ans in China see@@ k as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in foreign emb@@ assi@@ es , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated .
these girls were so lucky .
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
these North Kore@@ ans were not so lucky .
every year , coun@@ t@@ less North Kore@@ ans are caught in China and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated to North Korea , where they can be tor@@ tured , imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed or publi@@ c@@ ly execu@@ ted .
even though I was really fortun@@ ate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
it 's tra@@ gic that North Kore@@ ans have to hi@@ de their identi@@ ties and struggle so hard just to survive .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an inst@@ ant .
that 's why , after 10 years of hi@@ ding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
sett@@ ling down in South Korea was a lot more challeng@@ ing than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
we are all Kore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different due to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion .
I even went through an identity crisis .
am I South Kore@@ an or North Kore@@ an ?
where am I from ? who am I ?
suddenly , there was no country I could pr@@ ou@@ dly call my own .
even though ad@@ ju@@ sting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entr@@ ance ex@@ am .
just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a sho@@ cking phone call .
the North Kore@@ an auth@@ orities inter@@ cep@@ ted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment , my family was going to be for@@ ci@@ bly re@@ moved to a de@@ sol@@ ate location in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
they had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them es@@ cape .
North Kore@@ ans have to travel incredible di@@ stances on the path to freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the bor@@ der between North Korea and South Korea , so , ir@@ on@@ ically , I took a flight back to China and I hea@@ ded toward the North Kore@@ an bor@@ der .
since my family could not speak Chinese , I had to gui@@ de them , somehow , through more than 2000 miles in China and then into Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
one time , our bus was stopped and bo@@ ar@@ ded by a Chinese police officer .
he took everyone 's I@@ .@@ D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
since my family could not understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arre@@ sted .
as the Chinese officer approa@@ ched my family , I imp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely stood up , and I told him that these are dea@@ f and du@@ mb people that I was cha@@ per@@ on@@ ing .
he looked at me su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ously , but lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly he believed me .
we made it all the way to the bor@@ der of La@@ os , but I had to spend almost all my money to bri@@ be the bor@@ der gu@@ ards in La@@ os .
but even after we got past the bor@@ der , my family was arre@@ sted and ja@@ iled for il@@ legal bor@@ der cro@@ ssing .
after I paid the fine and bri@@ be , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arre@@ sted and ja@@ iled again in the capital of La@@ os .
this was one of the lo@@ west points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thro@@ wn in ja@@ il just a short distance from the South Kore@@ an emb@@ as@@ sy .
I went back and forth between the im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion office and the police station , de@@ sper@@ ately trying to get my family out , but I did not have enough money to pay a bri@@ be or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
at that moment , I heard one man 's voice ask me , " What 's wrong ? "
I was so surprised that a total str@@ anger car@@ ed enough to ask .
in my broken English , and with a di@@ ction@@ ary , I explained the situation , and without h@@ es@@ it@@ ating , the man went to the AT@@ M and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Kore@@ ans to get out of ja@@ il .
I than@@ ked him with all my heart , and I asked him , " Why are you helping me ? "
" I am not helping you , " he said .
" I am helping the North Kore@@ an people . "
I realized that this was a symbo@@ lic moment in my life .
the kind str@@ anger symbo@@ li@@ zed new hope for me and the North Kore@@ an people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kin@@ dness of str@@ ang@@ ers and the support of the international community are truly the ra@@ ys of hope we North Kore@@ an people need .
eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were re@@ un@@ ited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
many North Kore@@ ans are separ@@ ated from their families , and when they arri@@ ve in a new country , they start with little or no money .
so we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I have been so lucky , received so much help and inspi@@ ration in my life , so I want to help give as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing North Kore@@ ans a chance to pro@@ sp@@ er with international support .
I am confi@@ dent that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succe@@ e@@ ding all over the world , including the TED stage .
thank you .
today I have just one re@@ quest .
please do not tell me I am normal .
now I would like to introduce you to my bro@@ thers .
Re@@ mi is 22 , t@@ all and very hand@@ some .
he 's spee@@ ch@@ less , but he communi@@ c@@ ates joy in a way that some of the best or@@ ators cannot .
Re@@ mi knows what love is .
he shares it un@@ condi@@ tionally and he shares it regar@@ d@@ less .
he 's not gree@@ dy . he does not see skin color .
he does not care about religious differences , and get this : he has never told a lie .
when he si@@ ngs so@@ ngs from our childhood , attemp@@ ting words that not even I could remember , he re@@ minds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the un@@ known must be .
Sa@@ mu@@ el is 16 . he 's t@@ all . he 's very hand@@ some .
he has the most im@@ pe@@ c@@ ca@@ ble memory .
he has a se@@ lec@@ tive one , though .
he does not remember if he sto@@ le my cho@@ col@@ ate bar , but he reme@@ mbers the year of release for every song on my iP@@ od , conver@@ sa@@ tions we had when he was four , wee@@ ing on my arm on the first ever epi@@ so@@ de of T@@ ele@@ tu@@ b@@ bies , and Lad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a 's birthday .
do not they sound incredible ?
but most people do not agree .
and in fact , because their minds do not fit into society 's version of normal , they are often by@@ passed and mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood .
but what lif@@ ted my heart and streng@@ th@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- au@@ ti@@ stic and extraordinary .
now , for you who may be less familiar with the term " autism , " it 's a complex brain dis@@ order that affe@@ cts social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
it mani@@ fe@@ sts in each individual differently , h@@ ence why Re@@ mi is so different from S@@ am .
and across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagno@@ sed with autism , and although it 's one of the fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing develo@@ p@@ mental dis@@ orders in the world , there is no known cause or cu@@ re .
and I cannot remember the first moment I en@@ coun@@ tered autism , but I cannot re@@ call a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
and after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
he scre@@ amed a lot .
he did not want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he did not seem very interested in me wha@@ t@@ so@@ ever .
Re@@ mi lived and re@@ ig@@ ned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the sm@@ alle@@ st things , like lin@@ ing up cars around the room and star@@ ing at the wa@@ shing machine and eating anything that came in between .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
yet beyond the tan@@ tru@@ ms and the fru@@ stration and the ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending hy@@ per@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and inno@@ cent nature , a boy who saw the world without pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , a human who had never lied .
extraordinary .
now , I cannot den@@ y that there have been some challeng@@ ing moments in my family , moments where I have wi@@ shed that they were just like me .
but I cast my mind back to the things that they have taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I would not want to change with norm@@ ality .
norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different does not mean that one of us is wrong .
it just means that there 's a different kind of right .
and if I could communicate just one thing to Re@@ mi and to S@@ am and to you , it would be that you do not have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because au@@ ti@@ stic or not , the differences that we have -- We have got a gift ! everyone 's got a gift inside of us , and in all hone@@ sty , the pur@@ suit of norm@@ ality is the ul@@ timate sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of potential .
the chance for gre@@ at@@ ness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
please -- do not tell me I am normal .
thank you .
you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
it 's made of as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , and as@@ ph@@ al@@ t is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it 's ra@@ ining a lot .
then you can have a lot of sp@@ la@@ sh water in the as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
and especially if you then ride with your bi@@ cycle , and pass these cars , then that 's not very nice .
also , as@@ ph@@ al@@ t can create a lot of noise .
it 's a no@@ is@@ y material , and if we produce ro@@ ads like in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , very close to cities , then we would like a sil@@ ent road .
the solution for that is to make ro@@ ads out of por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , a material that we use now in most of the high@@ ways in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , it has po@@ res and water can just rain through it , so all the ra@@ in@@ water will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that 's easy to drive on , so no sp@@ la@@ sh water anymore .
also the noise will disappe@@ ar in these po@@ res .
because it 's very hol@@ low , all the noise will disappe@@ ar , so it 's a very sil@@ ent road .
it also has disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ges , of course , and the disa@@ d@@ van@@ tage of this road is that ra@@ v@@ eling can occur .
what is ra@@ v@@ eling ? you see that in this road that the st@@ ones at the surface come off .
first you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , I will not do that .
but they can damage your win@@ d@@ shi@@ eld , so you are not happy with that .
and finally , this ra@@ v@@ eling can also lead to more and more damage .
sometimes you can create po@@ th@@ ol@@ es with that .
ha . he 's ready .
po@@ th@@ ol@@ es , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
here you see actually how the damage appe@@ ars in this material .
it 's a por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , like I said , so you have only a small amount of bin@@ der between the st@@ ones .
due to wea@@ ther@@ ing , due to U.@@ V@@ . light , due to o@@ xi@@ d@@ ation , this bin@@ der , this bit@@ u@@ men , the glu@@ e between the aggre@@ g@@ ates is going to sh@@ r@@ ink , and if it sh@@ rin@@ ks , it gets micro@@ -@@ cr@@ acks , and it de@@ la@@ min@@ ates from the aggre@@ g@@ ates .
then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggre@@ g@@ ates -- what we just saw here .
to solve this problem , we thought of self-@@ heal@@ ing materials .
if we can make this material self-@@ heal@@ ing , then probably we have a solution .
so what we can do is use ste@@ el w@@ ool just to clean p@@ ans , and the ste@@ el w@@ ool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the bit@@ u@@ men .
so then you have as@@ ph@@ al@@ t with very small pieces of ste@@ el w@@ ool in it .
then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for coo@@ king -- an indu@@ ction machine .
indu@@ ction can heat , especially ste@@ el ; it 's very good at that .
then what you do is you heat up the ste@@ el , you mel@@ t the bit@@ u@@ men , and the bit@@ u@@ men will flow into these micro@@ -@@ cr@@ acks , and the st@@ ones are again fixed to the surface .
today I use a micro@@ wave because I cannot take the big indu@@ ction machine here on@@ stage .
so a micro@@ wave is a similar system .
so I put the speci@@ men in , which I am now going to take out to see what happened .
so this is the speci@@ men coming out now .
so I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the speci@@ men@@ s .
we te@@ sted a lot of speci@@ men@@ s there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , " Well , that 's very interesting . we have to try that . "
so they don@@ ated to us a piece of high@@ way , 400 meters of the A@@ 5@@ 8 , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
so that 's what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that 's what we know from practice .
so we took a lot of sa@@ mples from this road and we te@@ sted them in the lab .
so we did aging on the sa@@ mples , did a lot of lo@@ ading on it , heal@@ ed them with our indu@@ ction machine , and heal@@ ed them and te@@ sted them again .
several times we can repe@@ at that .
so actually , the conclu@@ sion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our heal@@ ing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course sa@@ ves a lot of money .
well , to conclu@@ de , I can say that we made a material using ste@@ el fi@@ b@@ ers , the addition of ste@@ el fi@@ b@@ ers , using indu@@ ction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tri@@ cks .
and now you are of course curious if it also worked .
so we still have the speci@@ men here . it 's quite warm .
actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the heal@@ ing works .
but I will do a trial .
let 's see . yeah , it worked .
thank you .
I am here today to talk about a di@@ stur@@ bing question , which has an equ@@ ally di@@ stur@@ bing answer .
my topic is the secre@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence , and the question I am going to t@@ ack@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : why does she stay ?
why would anyone stay with a man who be@@ ats her ?
I am not a psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tri@@ st , a social wor@@ ker or an exper@@ t in dom@@ es@@ tic violence .
I am just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just gradu@@ ated from Harvard Col@@ lege .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writ@@ er and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ even@@ teen magazine .
I had my first a@@ partment , my first little green American Ex@@ press card , and I had a very big secret .
my secret was that I had this gun lo@@ aded with hol@@ low-@@ point bul@@ lets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my sou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times .
the man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and thre@@ at@@ ened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I am here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gui@@ sed as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
it may even be your story .
I do not look like a typical dom@@ es@@ tic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
I have a B@@ .@@ A. in English from Harvard Col@@ lege , an M@@ B@@ A in marketing from W@@ har@@ ton Bu@@ sin@@ ess School .
I have spent most of my career working for For@@ tu@@ ne 500 companies including John@@ son & amp ; John@@ son , Le@@ o Bur@@ net@@ t and The Washington Po@@ st .
I have been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
my dog is a black lab , and I drive a H@@ on@@ da O@@ dy@@ sse@@ y mini@@ van .
so my first message for you is that dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to everyone -- all rac@@ es , all religi@@ ons , all income and education levels .
it 's everywhere .
and my second message is that everyone thinks dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to women , that it 's a women 's issue .
not exactly .
over 85 percent of abu@@ sers are men , and dom@@ es@@ tic abu@@ se happens only in in@@ timate , inter@@ depen@@ dent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason dom@@ es@@ tic abu@@ se is so confu@@ sing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who be@@ ats me , but in fact I was a very typical vi@@ c@@ tim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be dom@@ es@@ tic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abu@@ sive part@@ ners , bo@@ y@@ friends , and hus@@ b@@ ands in the United States .
I was also a very typical vi@@ c@@ tim because I knew nothing about dom@@ es@@ tic violence , its war@@ ning signs or its patterns .
I met Con@@ or on a cold , ra@@ in@@ y Jan@@ u@@ ary night .
he sat next to me on the New York City sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up .
he told me two things .
one was that he , too , had just gradu@@ ated from an I@@ vy Lea@@ gue school , and that he worked at a very impre@@ ssive Wall Street bank .
but what made the biggest impre@@ ssion on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
he had these big che@@ e@@ ks , these big app@@ le che@@ e@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ ond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
one of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the illu@@ sion that I was the domin@@ ant partner in the relationship .
he did this especially at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ zing me .
we started da@@ ting , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I would gone to Harvard , that I was pas@@ sionate about helping teen@@ age girls , and my job .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my ho@@ pes and dreams .
Con@@ or believed in me , as a writ@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
and he also created a ma@@ gi@@ cal atmosphere of trust between us by con@@ f@@ es@@ sing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been sa@@ va@@ ge@@ ly and repe@@ ate@@ dly physi@@ cally abu@@ sed by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the abu@@ se had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th grade , even though he was very smart , and he would spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life .
which is why that I@@ vy Lea@@ gue degree and the Wall Street job and his bright sh@@ in@@ y future meant so much to him .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who a@@ do@@ red me would one day di@@ ct@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how short my ski@@ r@@ ts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laugh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ int of violence or control or anger in Con@@ or at the beginning .
I did not know that the first stage in any dom@@ es@@ tic violence relationship is to se@@ du@@ ce and char@@ m the vi@@ c@@ tim .
I also did not know that the second step is to i@@ sol@@ ate the vi@@ c@@ tim .
now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and announ@@ ce , " You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next ph@@ ase where I i@@ sol@@ ate you and I abu@@ se you " — — " so I need to get you out of this a@@ partment where the neighb@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ workers who can see the bru@@ i@@ ses . "
instead , Con@@ or came home one Fri@@ day evening and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he did not need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abu@@ sive , dy@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces for your sou@@ l@@ mate , so I agre@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking head@@ first into a carefully la@@ id physical , financial and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p .
the next step in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she re@@ acts .
and here 's where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
as soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Con@@ nor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three g@@ un@@ s .
he kept one in the g@@ love com@@ partment of our car .
he kept one under the pil@@ lows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his po@@ cket at all times .
and he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the trau@@ ma he would experienced as a young boy .
he needed them to feel prote@@ cted .
but those g@@ un@@ s were really a message for me , and even though he hadn ' t raised a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve dang@@ er every minute of every day .
Con@@ or first physi@@ cally att@@ acked me five days before our we@@ dding .
it was 7 a@@ .@@ m. I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a fre@@ el@@ ance writing as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got fru@@ str@@ ated , and Con@@ or used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my ne@@ ck and to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze so ti@@ ghtly that I could not brea@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to hit my head repe@@ ate@@ dly against the wall .
five days later , the ten bru@@ i@@ ses on my ne@@ ck had just f@@ aded , and I put on my mother 's we@@ dding dress , and I married him .
despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
and he was very , very sorry .
he had just been really str@@ es@@ sed out by the we@@ dding and by becoming a family with me .
it was an i@@ sol@@ ated inci@@ dent , and he was never going to hurt me again .
it happened twice more on the hone@@ y@@ moon .
the first time , I was driving to find a secret be@@ ach and I got lost , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repe@@ ate@@ dly hit the driver 's side window .
and then a few days later , driving home from our hone@@ y@@ moon , he got fru@@ str@@ ated by traffic , and he thre@@ w a cold Big Mac in my face .
Con@@ or proce@@ e@@ ded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mista@@ ken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
one in three American women experiences dom@@ es@@ tic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C reports that 15 million children are abu@@ sed every year , 15 million .
so actually , I was in very good company .
back to my question : why did I stay ?
the answer is easy .
I did not know he was abu@@ sing me .
even though he held those lo@@ aded g@@ un@@ s to my head , pu@@ shed me down sta@@ irs , thre@@ at@@ ened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ig@@ ni@@ tion as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red coffee gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I dre@@ ssed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a bat@@ tered wife .
instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply trou@@ b@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his demon@@ s .
the other question everybody as@@ ks is , why does not she just leave ?
why did not I walk out ? I could have left any time .
to me , this is the sa@@ d@@ dest and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually do not : it 's incredibly dangerous to leave an abu@@ ser .
because the final step in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence pattern is kill her .
over 70 percent of dom@@ es@@ tic violence mur@@ ders happen after the vi@@ c@@ tim has ended the relationship , after she 's gotten out , because then the abu@@ ser has nothing left to lose .
other out@@ comes include long-term st@@ al@@ king , even after the abu@@ ser remar@@ ries ; den@@ i@@ al of financial resources ; and mani@@ pu@@ lation of the family court system to terri@@ fy the vi@@ c@@ tim and her children , who are regu@@ larly forced by family court ju@@ dges to spend un@@ super@@ vi@@ sed time with the man who beat their mother .
and still we ask , why does not she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sa@@ di@@ stic be@@ ating that broke through my den@@ i@@ al .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
so I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighb@@ ors , my friends and family , total str@@ ang@@ ers , and I am here today because you all helped me .
we tend to ster@@ e@@ o@@ type victims as gri@@ s@@ ly head@@ lines , self-@@ destru@@ ctive women , dama@@ ged goods .
the question , " Why does she stay ? "
is code for some people for , " It 's her fault for sta@@ ying , " as if victims inten@@ tionally choose to fall in love with men in@@ tent upon destro@@ ying us .
but since publi@@ shing " C@@ ra@@ zy Lo@@ ve , " I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an in@@ valuable life lesson from what happened , and who re@@ built lives -- jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives -- as employees , wi@@ ves and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
because it turns out that I am actually a very typical dom@@ es@@ tic violence vi@@ c@@ tim and a typical dom@@ es@@ tic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
I remar@@ ried a kind and gen@@ tle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that mini@@ van .
what I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ aded gun held to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me .
right now , maybe you are thinking , " Wow , this is fascinating , " or , " Wow , how stupid was she , " but this whole time , I have actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abu@@ sed or who were abu@@ sed as children or who are abu@@ sers themselves .
abu@@ se could be affe@@ cting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I am still breaking the silence today .
it 's my way of helping other victims , and it 's my final re@@ quest of you .
talk about what you heard here .
abu@@ se thri@@ ves only in silence .
you have the power to end dom@@ es@@ tic violence simply by sh@@ ining a spo@@ t@@ light on it .
we victims need everyone .
we need every one of you to understand the secre@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence .
show abu@@ se the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ workers , your friends and family .
re@@ cast survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with full fu@@ tures .
recognize the early signs of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously interven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show victims a safe way out .
together we can make our be@@ ds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and pe@@ ace@@ ful o@@ ases they should be .
thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
there are 10000 species of birds in the world .
vul@@ tures are a@@ mo@@ ng@@ st the most thre@@ at@@ ened group of birds .
when you see a vul@@ ture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are dis@@ gu@@ sting , u@@ g@@ ly , gree@@ dy creatures that are just after your fle@@ sh , associated with politici@@ ans .
I want to change that per@@ ception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our symp@@ athy . they really do .
and I will tell you why .
first of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
when Charles Darwin went across the Atlan@@ tic in 18@@ 32 on the B@@ ea@@ gle , he saw the tur@@ key vul@@ ture , and he said , " The@@ se are dis@@ gu@@ sting birds with bal@@ d S@@ car@@ let heads that are formed to re@@ vel in pu@@ tri@@ d@@ ity . "
you could not get a worse insul@@ t , and that from Charles Darwin .
you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I will tell you why .
they have also be associated with Dis@@ ney — — person@@ i@@ fied as go@@ of@@ y , du@@ mb , stupid characters .
more recently , if you have been following the Ken@@ yan press — — these are the at@@ tribu@@ tes that they associated the Ken@@ yan M@@ P@@ s with . but I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . do you know why ?
because M@@ P@@ s do not keep the environment clean .
M@@ P@@ s do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
they are har@@ dly mon@@ o@@ gam@@ ous .
they are far from being ex@@ tin@@ ct .
and , my favorite is , vul@@ tures are better looking .
so there 's two types of vul@@ tures in this planet .
there are the New World vul@@ tures that are main@@ ly found in the Americ@@ as , like the con@@ d@@ ors and the car@@ ac@@ ar@@ as , and then the O@@ ld World vul@@ tures , where we have 16 species . from these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of ex@@ tin@@ ction .
so why are vul@@ tures important ? first of all , they provide v@@ ital eco@@ logical services . they clean up .
they are our natural gar@@ b@@ age colle@@ ctors .
they clean up car@@ ca@@ sses right to the bone .
they help to kill all the bacteria . they help ab@@ sor@@ b an@@ th@@ ra@@ x that would otherwise spread and cause huge li@@ ve@@ stock lo@@ sses and diseases in other animals .
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vul@@ tures , car@@ ca@@ sses take up to three to four times to de@@ com@@ pose , and this has huge ra@@ mi@@ fi@@ cations for the spread of diseases .
vul@@ tures also have tremendous histori@@ cal signific@@ ance .
they have been associated in ancient Egy@@ pti@@ an culture .
Ne@@ kh@@ bet was the symbo@@ l of the prote@@ ctor and the mo@@ ther@@ hood , and together with the co@@ b@@ ra , symbo@@ li@@ zed the un@@ ity between U@@ pper and Lo@@ wer Egy@@ pt .
in H@@ in@@ du my@@ tho@@ logy , J@@ at@@ a@@ y@@ u was the vul@@ ture go@@ d , and he ri@@ s@@ ked his life in order to save the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss S@@ ita from the 10@@ -@@ hea@@ ded De@@ mon Ra@@ van@@ a .
in Ti@@ be@@ tan culture , they are perfor@@ ming very important sky bu@@ ri@@ als . in places like Ti@@ bet , there are no places to bu@@ ry the dead , or wood to cre@@ mate them , so these vul@@ tures provide a natural dis@@ po@@ sal system .
so what is the problem with vul@@ tures ?
we have eight species of vul@@ tures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly thre@@ at@@ ened with ex@@ tin@@ ction .
the reason is that they are getting po@@ is@@ oned , and the reason that they are getting po@@ is@@ oned is because there 's human@@ -@@ wil@@ d@@ life confli@@ cts . the pa@@ stor@@ al communities are using this po@@ i@@ son to target pre@@ dat@@ ors , and in return , the vul@@ tures are falling vi@@ c@@ tim to this .
in South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vul@@ tures are li@@ sted as cri@@ tically en@@ dang@@ ered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go ex@@ tin@@ ct , and the reason is because they are falling pre@@ y by consu@@ ming li@@ ve@@ stock that has been treated with a pain@@ killing drug like D@@ ic@@ lo@@ f@@ en@@ a@@ c .
this drug has now been ban@@ ned for ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
because there are no vul@@ tures , there 's been a spread in the numbers of fer@@ al dogs at car@@ ca@@ ss du@@ mp sites , and when you have fer@@ al dogs , you have a huge time bom@@ b of ra@@ bies . the number of cases of ra@@ bies has increased tremend@@ ously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind far@@ ms in Africa : 3@@ 5@@ 3 wind tur@@ b@@ ines are going to be up at La@@ ke Tur@@ k@@ ana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind tur@@ b@@ ines do this to birds . they sli@@ ce them in half .
they are bir@@ d-@@ bl@@ ending machines .
in West Africa , there 's a horri@@ fic trade of dead vul@@ tures to serve the wit@@ ch@@ craft and the fe@@ tish market .
so what 's being done ? well , we are condu@@ cting research on these birds . we are putting trans@@ mit@@ ters on them .
we are trying to determine their basic eco@@ logy , and see where they go .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem lo@@ cally , it 's not going to help you .
we need to work with governments in regi@@ onal levels .
we are working with local communities .
we are talking to them about appreci@@ ating vul@@ tures , about the need from within to appreci@@ ate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
how can you help ? you can become active , make noise . you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood creatures . volunte@@ er your time to spread the word . spread the word .
when you walk out of this room , you will be infor@@ med about vul@@ tures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighb@@ ors about vul@@ tures .
they are very gr@@ ace@@ ful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effor@@ t@@ less@@ ly without energy in the ski@@ es .
Kenya , this world , will be much po@@ ore@@ r without these wonderful species .
thank you very much .
when I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my father was listening to BBC News on his small , gr@@ ay radio .
there was a big smile on his face which was un@@ usual then , because the news mostly de@@ pressed him .
" the Tali@@ ban are gone ! " my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I did not know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
" you can go to a real school now , " he said .
a morning that I will never forget .
a real school .
you see , I was six when the Tali@@ ban took over Afghanistan and made it il@@ legal for girls to go to school .
so for the next five years , I dre@@ ssed as a boy to es@@ c@@ ort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
it was the only way we both could be edu@@ cated .
each day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would suspe@@ ct where we were going .
we would cover our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sho@@ pping .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ acked in one small living room .
it was co@@ zy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
we all knew we were ri@@ s@@ king our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because Tali@@ ban were su@@ spi@@ cious .
we always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
were we being followed ?
do they know where we live ?
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters were tr@@ ea@@ su@@ red .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
a total ma@@ ver@@ ick from a remote pro@@ vin@@ ce of Afghanistan , he insi@@ sted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father .
but my edu@@ cated mother became a teacher .
there she is .
she reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
and my father -- that 's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , despite the Tali@@ ban , despite the risks .
to him , there was greater risk in not edu@@ cating his children .
during Tali@@ ban years , I remember there were times I would get so fru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , " Li@@ st@@ en , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
your money can be st@@ ol@@ en . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will .
so do you still not want to continue ? "
today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destro@@ yed by decades of war .
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so commit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them .
instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ bu@@ ry Col@@ lege .
when I re@@ turned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to edu@@ cate his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , was among the first to cong@@ r@@ atu@@ late me .
he not only bra@@ gs about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Ka@@ bu@@ l .
my family believ@@ es in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
that 's why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to edu@@ cate women .
that 's why I co@@ f@@ ounded SO@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it 's still ri@@ sky for girls to go to school .
the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ bing at opportunity .
and I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ cate for them , despite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position .
like Ah@@ med . that 's not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ah@@ med is the father of one of my students .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SO@@ L@@ A to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes .
as he arrived home , the phone r@@ ang , a voice war@@ ning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
" kill me now , if you wish , " he said , " but I will not ru@@ in my daughter 's future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . "
what I have come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succe@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ zes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
it 's not to say that our mothers aren ' t key in our success .
in fact , they are often the initi@@ al and convin@@ cing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
under the Tali@@ ban , girls who went to school nu@@ mb@@ ered in the hundreds -- remember , it was il@@ legal .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fra@@ gi@@ li@@ ty in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ ops ' with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ vo@@ cate for them , who encourage them , I see a promi@@ sing future and la@@ sting change .
to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bound@@ less possi@@ bilities , and every single day the girls of SO@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that .
like me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big .
thank you .
Hi . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
with a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Sy@@ ria .
with a mobile phone , you can tw@@ e@@ et a message and start a prote@@ st in Egy@@ pt .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to S@@ ound@@ C@@ loud and become famous .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
I am a child of 198@@ 4 , and I live in the city of Ber@@ lin .
let 's go back to that time , to this city .
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and prote@@ sted for change .
this is au@@ tum@@ n 198@@ 9 , and imagine that all those people standing up and pro@@ testing for change had a mobile phone in their po@@ cket .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
hold it up .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
hold it up . an Android , a B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , wo@@ w .
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
and I will talk about this .
these are 3@@ 5@@ 8@@ 30 lines of information .
ra@@ w data .
and why are these infor@@ ma@@ tions there ?
because in the summer of 2006 , the E@@ .@@ U@@ . Com@@ mission tab@@ led a dire@@ ctive .
this dire@@ ctive [ is ] called D@@ ata re@@ ten@@ tion dire@@ ctive .
this dire@@ ctive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
who calls whom ? who sen@@ ds whom an email ?
who sen@@ ds whom a text message ?
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
all this information is sto@@ red for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provi@@ der .
and all over Europe , people stood up and said , " We do not want this . "
they said , we do not want this data re@@ ten@@ tion .
we want self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age , and we do not want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
they were law@@ yers , journ@@ alists , pri@@ e@@ sts , they all said : " we do not want this . "
and here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Ber@@ lin and said , " F@@ ree@@ dom , not fear . "
and some even said , this would be S@@ ta@@ si 2 point 0 .
S@@ ta@@ si was the secret police in East Germany .
and I also ask myself , does it really work ?
can they really store all this information about us ?
every time I use my mobile phone ?
so I asked my phone company , De@@ u@@ t@@ sch@@ e T@@ ele@@ k@@ om , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have sto@@ red about me .
and I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . it was only bla@@ h bla@@ h answers .
but then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are proto@@ co@@ ling .
so I decided to start a law@@ suit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
but De@@ u@@ t@@ sch@@ e T@@ ele@@ k@@ om said , no , we will not give you this information .
so at the end , I had a sett@@ le@@ ment with them .
I will put down the law@@ suit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
because in the mean time , the German con@@ stitu@@ tional C@@ our@@ t ru@@ led that the imple@@ men@@ tation of this E@@ .@@ U@@ . dire@@ ctive into German law was un@@ con@@ stitu@@ tional .
so I got this u@@ g@@ ly bro@@ wn en@@ velo@@ pe with a C@@ .@@ D. inside .
and on the C@@ .@@ D. , this was on .
Thi@@ r@@ ty-@@ five thousand eight hundred thir@@ ty lines of information .
at first I saw it , and I said , okay , it 's a huge file . okay .
but then after a while I realized , this is my life .
this is six months of my life , into this file .
so I was a little bit ske@@ p@@ tical , what should I do with it ?
because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
but then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
because I want to show the people what does data re@@ ten@@ tion mean .
so together with Ze@@ it O@@ n@@ line and O@@ pen D@@ ata City , I did this .
this is a visu@@ alization of six months of my life .
you can z@@ oo@@ m in and z@@ oo@@ m out , you can wind back and fast forward .
you can see every step I take .
and you can even see how I go from Fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t by train to co@@ lo@@ g@@ ne , and how often I call in between .
all this is possible with this information .
that 's a little bit sc@@ ary .
but it is not only about me .
it 's about all of us .
first , it 's only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
but you can see how your people are communi@@ cating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
you can see all of this .
you can see the hu@@ bs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
if you have access to this information , you can control your society .
this is a blu@@ e@@ print for countries like China and Iran .
this is a blu@@ e@@ print how to sur@@ vey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sen@@ ds whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
and this information is sto@@ red for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Ber@@ lin in au@@ tum@@ n of 198@@ 9 had a mobile phone in their po@@ cket .
and the S@@ ta@@ si would have known who took part at this prote@@ st , and if the S@@ ta@@ si would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
the fall of the Ber@@ lin Wall would maybe not [ have been ] there .
and in the after@@ math , also not the fall of the I@@ ron C@@ ur@@ tain .
because today , state agen@@ cies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and off@@ line .
they want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
but self-@@ determin@@ ation and living in the digital age is no con@@ tradi@@ ction .
but you have to fight for your self-@@ determin@@ ation today .
you have to fight for it every day .
so , when you go home , tell your friends that pri@@ v@@ acy is a value of the 2@@ 1@@ st century , and it 's not out@@ d@@ ated .
when you go home , tell your represen@@ ta@@ tive only because companies and state agen@@ cies have the possibility to store certain information , they do not have to do it .
and if you do not believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
so , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a re@@ min@@ der to you that you have to fight for self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age .
thank you .
photograph@@ y has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most tr@@ ea@@ su@@ red photos of mine , and I did not take any of them .
there were no art dire@@ ctors , no sty@@ li@@ sts , no chance for re@@ shoo@@ ts , not even any re@@ g@@ ard for li@@ ghting .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tou@@ ri@@ sts .
my story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking eng@@ agement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we are on the corner of 5@@ 7@@ th and 5@@ th .
we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
well you can see where this is going .
approa@@ ching my daughter 's third birthday , my wife said , " Hey , why do not you take S@@ ab@@ ina back to New York and make it a fa@@ ther@@ -@@ daughter trip , and continue the rit@@ u@@ al ? "
this is when we started asking pas@@ sing tou@@ ri@@ sts to take the picture .
you know , it 's remarkable how univer@@ sal the ge@@ stu@@ re is of h@@ anding your camera to a total str@@ anger .
no one 's ever refu@@ sed , and lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly no one 's ever run off with our camera .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
it 's really become sac@@ red to us .
this one was taken just weeks after 9@@ /@@ 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old could understand .
so these photos are far more than pro@@ xi@@ es for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
they are also ways for us to free@@ ze time for one week in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber and refle@@ ct on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physi@@ cally , but in every way .
because while we take the same photo , our perspe@@ cti@@ ves change , and she rea@@ ches new mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she inter@@ acts with and sees everything .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we ch@@ eri@@ sh and anti@@ cip@@ ate the entire year .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stop@@ s dead in her trac@@ ks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the do@@ ll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier tri@@ ps .
and she descri@@ bes to me the feeling she felt as a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old standing in that exact spot .
she said she reme@@ mbers her heart bur@@ sting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
and now what she 's looking at in New York are colle@@ ges , because she 's determin@@ ed to go to school in New York .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consci@@ ously creating memories .
I do not know about you , but a@@ side from these 15 sho@@ ts , I am not in many of the family photos .
I am always the one taking the picture .
so I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and do not h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and ask , " W@@ ill you take our picture ? "
thank you .
I have never , ever for@@ gotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exi@@ le : " son , resi@@ st G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i . fight him .
but do not you ever turn into a G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ -@@ like revo@@ lu@@ tionary . "
almost two years have passed since the Lib@@ yan R@@ evolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mo@@ bili@@ zation in both the T@@ uni@@ sian and the Egy@@ pti@@ an revo@@ lu@@ tions .
I jo@@ ined forces with many other Lib@@ y@@ ans inside and outside Lib@@ ya to call for a day of ra@@ ge and to initi@@ ate a revolution against the ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal regi@@ me of G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i .
and there it was , a great revolution .
young Lib@@ yan women and men were at the fore@@ front calling for the fall of the regi@@ me , rai@@ sing slo@@ g@@ ans of freedom , dig@@ nity , social justice .
they have shown an ex@@ emp@@ l@@ ary bra@@ very in con@@ fron@@ ting the bru@@ tal di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship of G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i .
they have shown a great sense of soli@@ dar@@ ity from the far east to the far west to the south .
eventually , after a period of six months of bru@@ tal war and a to@@ ll rate of almost 5@@ 0000 dead , we managed to liber@@ ate our country and to to@@ pp@@ le the ty@@ rant .
however , G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i left behind a heavy bur@@ den , a leg@@ acy of ty@@ ran@@ ny , corruption and see@@ ds of di@@ ver@@ sions .
for four decades G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i 's ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal regi@@ me destro@@ yed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral f@@ ab@@ ric of Lib@@ yan society .
aware of the de@@ va@@ station and the challenges , I was ke@@ en among many other women to re@@ build the Lib@@ yan civil society , calling for an inclu@@ sive and just transi@@ tion to democracy and national re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
almost 200 organizations were estab@@ li@@ shed in B@@ eng@@ ha@@ z@@ i during and immediately after the fall of G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i -- almost 300 in Tri@@ pol@@ i .
after a period of 33 years in exi@@ le , I went back to Lib@@ ya , and with unique en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m , I started organi@@ zing work@@ sho@@ ps on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
with an amazing group of women , I co-@@ f@@ ounded the Lib@@ yan W@@ om@@ en 's P@@ l@@ at@@ form for Pe@@ ace , a movement of women , leaders , from different wal@@ ks of life , to lo@@ b@@ by for the soci@@ op@@ oli@@ tical em@@ power@@ ment of women and to lo@@ b@@ by for our right for equal particip@@ ation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-@@ elec@@ tions , an environment which was increasingly po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed , an environment which was sha@@ ped by the sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and ex@@ clu@@ sion .
I led an initi@@ ative by the Lib@@ yan W@@ om@@ en 's P@@ l@@ at@@ form for Pe@@ ace to lo@@ b@@ by for a more inclu@@ sive ele@@ ct@@ oral law , a law that would give every citiz@@ en , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to sti@@ pu@@ late on political par@@ ties the alter@@ nation of male and female candi@@ dates ver@@ tically and h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tally in their li@@ sts , creating the zi@@ pper list .
eventually , our initi@@ ative was adop@@ ted and successful .
women won 17 point 5 percent of the National Congress in the first elec@@ tions ever in 5@@ 2 years .
however , bit by bit , the eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a of the elec@@ tions , and of the revolution as a whole , was f@@ ading out -- for every day we were wa@@ king up to the news of violence .
one day we wake up to the news of the de@@ se@@ cra@@ tion of ancient mosqu@@ es and Su@@ f@@ i T@@ om@@ bs .
on another day we wake up to the news of the mur@@ der of the American am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and the attack on the con@@ sul@@ ate .
on another day we wake up to the news of the assa@@ s@@ sin@@ ation of army offi@@ cers .
and every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the mili@@ ti@@ as and their continu@@ ous vi@@ o@@ lations of human rights of pri@@ son@@ ers and their dis@@ respect of the rule of law .
our society , sha@@ ped by a revo@@ lu@@ tionary min@@ d@@ set , became more po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed and has driven away from the ide@@ als and the prin@@ cipl@@ es -- freedom , dig@@ nity , social justice -- that we first held .
in@@ to@@ ler@@ ance , ex@@ clu@@ sion and reve@@ nge became the i@@ con@@ s of the [ after@@ math ] of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to inspi@@ re you with our success story of the zi@@ pper list and the elec@@ tions .
I am rather here today to con@@ f@@ ess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
we did not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze right .
for elec@@ tions did not bring peace and sta@@ bility and security in Lib@@ ya .
did the zi@@ pper list and the alter@@ nation between female and male candi@@ dates bring peace and national re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ?
no , it did not .
what is it , then ?
why does our society continue to be po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed and domin@@ ated with sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and ex@@ clu@@ sion , by both men and women ?
maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the fe@@ min@@ ine values of compassion , mer@@ cy and inclu@@ sion .
our society needs national di@@ alogue and con@@ sen@@ su@@ s-@@ building more than it needed the elec@@ tions , which only re@@ infor@@ ced po@@ lar@@ i@@ zation and divi@@ sion .
our society needs the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative represen@@ tation of the fe@@ min@@ ine more than it needs the nu@@ mer@@ ical , quanti@@ ta@@ tive represen@@ tation of the fe@@ min@@ ine .
we need to stop acting as ag@@ ents of ra@@ ge and calling for days of ra@@ ge .
we need to start acting as ag@@ ents of compassion and mer@@ cy .
we need to develop a fe@@ min@@ ine disc@@ our@@ se that not only hon@@ ors but also imple@@ ments mer@@ cy instead of reve@@ nge , collabor@@ ation instead of competition , inclu@@ sion instead of ex@@ clu@@ sion .
these are the ide@@ als that a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Lib@@ ya needs de@@ sper@@ ately in order to achieve peace .
for peace has an al@@ che@@ my , and this al@@ che@@ my is about the inter@@ tw@@ ining , the alter@@ nation between the fe@@ min@@ ine and ma@@ scul@@ ine perspe@@ cti@@ ves .
that 's the real zi@@ pper .
and we need to estab@@ lish that exist@@ entially before we do so soci@@ op@@ oli@@ tically .
according to a Q@@ ur@@ anic verse " S@@ al@@ am " -- peace -- " is the word of the al@@ l-@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful God , Ra@@ he@@ em . "
in turn , the word " Ra@@ he@@ em , " which is known in all A@@ bra@@ ha@@ mic tradi@@ tions , has the same root in Ara@@ bic as the word " ra@@ h@@ em " -- wom@@ b -- symbo@@ li@@ zing the mat@@ er@@ nal fe@@ min@@ ine en@@ compas@@ sing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tri@@ bes , all peop@@ les , have e@@ man@@ ated from .
and so just as the wom@@ b entirely en@@ velo@@ pes the emb@@ r@@ yo , which gro@@ ws within it , the div@@ ine matrix of compassion n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shes the entire exist@@ ence .
th@@ us we are told that " My mer@@ cy en@@ compas@@ ses all things . "
th@@ us we are told that " My mer@@ cy takes pre@@ ce@@ dence over my anger . "
may we all be gran@@ ted a gr@@ ace of mer@@ cy .
thank you .
five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in W@@ on@@ der@@ land .
Pen@@ n State asked me , a communi@@ cations teacher , to teach a communi@@ cations class for engineering students .
and I was scared .
really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , un@@ familiar words .
but as these conver@@ sa@@ tions un@@ fol@@ ded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that r@@ ab@@ bit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
that 's just how I felt as I had those conver@@ sa@@ tions with the students . I was ama@@ zed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
we de@@ sper@@ ately need great communication from our scientists and engine@@ ers in order to change the world .
our scientists and engine@@ ers are the ones that are t@@ ack@@ ling our gran@@ dest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we do not know about it and understand it , then the work is not done , and I believe it 's our responsibility as non-@@ scientists to have these inter@@ actions .
but these great conver@@ sa@@ tions can ' t occur if our scientists and engine@@ ers do not inv@@ ite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
so scientists and engine@@ ers , please , talk ner@@ dy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is se@@ xy and that your engineering is eng@@ aging .
first question to answer for us : so what ?
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
do not just tell me that you study tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e , but tell me that you study tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e , which is the me@@ sh@@ -@@ like structure of our bones because it 's important to understanding and tr@@ eating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis .
and when you are descri@@ bing your science , be@@ ware of j@@ ar@@ g@@ on .
j@@ ar@@ g@@ on is a bar@@ ri@@ er to our understanding of your ideas .
sure , you can say " sp@@ ati@@ al and temp@@ oral , " but why not just say " space and time , " which is so much more ac@@ ces@@ sible to us ?
and making your ideas ac@@ ces@@ sible is not the same as du@@ mb@@ ing it down .
instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simp@@ ler .
you can clearly communicate your science without comp@@ r@@ omi@@ sing the ideas .
a few things to consider are having examples , stories and an@@ alo@@ gies . those are ways to engage and exc@@ ite us about your content .
and when presen@@ ting your work , drop the bul@@ let points .
have you ever wonder@@ ed why they are called bul@@ let points ?
what do bul@@ lets do ? bul@@ lets kill , and they will kill your presen@@ tation .
a slide like this is not only boring , but it re@@ lies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
instead , this example slide by Gen@@ evi@@ eve Bro@@ wn is much more effective . it 's showing that the special structure of tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the E@@ i@@ ffe@@ l To@@ wer .
and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visu@@ als which appe@@ al to our other sen@@ ses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what 's being described .
so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
and because the engine@@ ers that I have worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my in@@ ner ner@@ d , I want to sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ze with an equation .
take your science , sub@@ tract your bul@@ let points and your j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , divide by relev@@ ance , meaning share what 's relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you are doing , and that is going to equal incredible inter@@ actions that are full of understanding .
and so , scientists and engine@@ ers , when you have solved this equation , by all means , talk ner@@ dy to me .
thank you .
Hi . my name is Cam@@ er@@ on Ru@@ s@@ sell , and for the last little while I have been a model .
actually , for 10 years .
and I feel like there 's an un@@ comfortable ten@@ sion in the room right now because I should not have wor@@ n this dress .
so lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly I brought an out@@ fit change .
this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to wit@@ ness it , I think .
if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you do not have to tell me now , but I will find out later on Twitter .
I would also note that I am quite pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very bri@@ ef 10 seconds .
not everybody gets to do that .
these he@@ els are very un@@ comfortable , so good thing I was not going to wear them .
the worst part is putting this swe@@ ater over my head , because that 's when you will all laugh at me , so do not do anything while it 's over my head .
all right .
so why did I do that ?
that was aw@@ k@@ ward .
well , hopefully not as aw@@ k@@ ward as that picture .
image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
I just totally transfor@@ med what you thought of me in six seconds .
and in this picture , I had actually never had a bo@@ y@@ friend in real life .
I was totally un@@ comfortable , and the photograph@@ er was telling me to ar@@ ch my back and put my hand in that guy 's hair .
and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fa@@ ke tan that I got two days ago for work , there 's very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and immu@@ table , has a huge impact on our lives .
so today , for me , being fe@@ ar@@ less means being honest .
and I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a se@@ xy girl .
and I am going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest tw@@ ist .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and I always just say , " Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , " but that means nothing .
the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lo@@ t@@ tery , and I am the reci@@ pi@@ ent of a leg@@ acy , and maybe you are wondering what is a leg@@ acy .
well , for the past few cen@@ tu@@ ries we have defined beauty not just as health and you@@ th and sym@@ me@@ try that we are bio@@ logi@@ cally program@@ med to ad@@ mi@@ re , but also as t@@ all , s@@ len@@ der figures , and fe@@ min@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
and this is a leg@@ acy that was built for me , and it 's a leg@@ acy that I have been ca@@ shing out on .
and I know there are people in the audience who are ske@@ p@@ tical at this point , and maybe there are some fashi@@ oni@@ st@@ as who are , like , " Wa@@ it . Na@@ om@@ i . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ mal@@ ls . Li@@ u W@@ en . "
and first , I comm@@ end you on your model knowledge . very impre@@ ssive .
but unfortunately I have to infor@@ m you that in 2007 , a very inspired N@@ Y@@ U Ph@@ .@@ D. student coun@@ ted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hi@@ red , and of the 6@@ 7@@ 7 models that were hi@@ red , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-@@ white .
the next question people always ask me is , " C@@ an I be a model when I grow up ? "
and the first answer is , " I do not know , they do not put me in charge of that . "
but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , " Why ?
you know ? you can be anything .
you could be the President of the United States , or the inven@@ tor of the next Internet , or a n@@ in@@ j@@ a car@@ di@@ o-@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on po@@ et , which would be awesome , because you would be the first one . "
if , after this amazing list , they still are like , " No , no , Cam@@ er@@ on , I want to be a model , " well then I say , " B@@ e my boss . "
because I am not in charge of anything , and you could be the ed@@ it@@ or in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H & amp ; M , or the next Ste@@ ven M@@ ei@@ sel .
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is a@@ k@@ in to saying that you want to win the Po@@ wer@@ ball when you grow up .
it 's out of your control , and it 's awesome , and it 's not a career path .
I will demonstr@@ ate for you now 10 years of accu@@ mul@@ ated model knowledge , because un@@ like car@@ di@@ o-@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ ons , it can just be di@@ sti@@ l@@ led right into -- right now .
so if the photograph@@ er is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the cli@@ ent says , " Cam@@ er@@ on , we want a walking shot , " well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quar@@ ters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imag@@ in@@ ary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
it will look something like this .
hopefully less aw@@ k@@ ward than that one in the middle .
that was , I do not know what happened there .
unfortunately after you have gone to school , and you have a r@@ é@@ sum@@ é and you have done a few jobs , you can ' t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your r@@ é@@ sum@@ é rea@@ ds , " under@@ wear Mo@@ de@@ l : 10 years , " people give you a funny look .
the next question people always ask me is , " Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? "
and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small compon@@ ent of what 's happening .
this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it 's also the very first time that I had wor@@ n a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I did not even have my period yet .
I know we are getting personal , but I was a young girl .
this is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .
here 's me on the same day as this shoot .
my friend got to come with me .
here 's me at a s@@ lu@@ mber party a few days before I shot French Vo@@ gue .
here 's me on the so@@ c@@ cer team and in V M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine .
and here 's me today .
and I hope what you are seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
they are con@@ struc@@ tions , and they are con@@ struc@@ tions by a group of profes@@ sion@@ als , by ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ li@@ sts and ma@@ ke@@ up artists and photograph@@ ers and sty@@ li@@ sts and all of their assi@@ stan@@ ts and pre-@@ production and po@@ st-@@ production , and they build this . that 's not me .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , " Do you get free stuff ? "
I do have too many 8@@ -@@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that 's what we do not like to talk about .
I grew up in Cam@@ bridge , and one time I went into a store and I for@@ got my money and they gave me the dress for free .
when I was a teen@@ ager , I was driving with my friend who was an aw@@ ful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a " S@@ or@@ ry , officer , " and we were on our way .
and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0000 teen@@ agers that were stopped and fri@@ s@@ ked , 8@@ 6 percent of them were black and La@@ ti@@ no , and most of them were young men .
and there are only 17@@ 7@@ 000 young black and La@@ ti@@ no men in New York , so for them , it 's not a question of , " W@@ ill I get stopped ? "
but " How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? "
when I was resear@@ ching this talk , I found out that of the 13@@ -year-old girls in the United States , 5@@ 3 percent do not like their bodies , and that number goes to 7@@ 8 percent by the time that they are 17 .
so the last question people ask me is , " What is it like to be a model ? "
and I think the answer that they are looking for is , " If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ ini@@ er hair , you will be so happy and fa@@ bul@@ ous . "
and when we are back@@ stage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
we say , " It 's really amazing to travel , and it 's amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , pas@@ sionate people . "
and those things are true , but they are only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , " I am in@@ secu@@ re . "
and I am in@@ secu@@ re because I have to think about what I look like every day .
and if you ever are wondering , " If I have thin@@ ner thi@@ gh@@ s and sh@@ ini@@ er hair , will I be happ@@ i@@ er ? "
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thin@@ ne@@ st thi@@ gh@@ s and the sh@@ ini@@ est hair and the coo@@ le@@ st clothes , and they are the most physi@@ cally in@@ secu@@ re women probably on the planet .
so when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to stri@@ ke an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very un@@ comfortable to come out here and say , " L@@ ook I have received all these benefits from a de@@ ck st@@ acked in my fav@@ or , " and it also felt really un@@ comfortable to follow that up with , " and it does not always make me happy . "
but mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a leg@@ acy of gen@@ der and r@@ aci@@ al op@@ pression when I am one of the biggest ben@@ e@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries .
but I am also happy and hon@@ o@@ red to be up here and I think that it 's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I would had more agency in my career , because maybe then I would not tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I would not tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
if there 's a ta@@ k@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it 's that we all feel more comfortable ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the power of image in our percei@@ ved suc@@ ces@@ ses and our percei@@ ved fail@@ u@@ res .
thank you .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
we do not bu@@ mp into every neighb@@ or , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
so over the past few years , I have tried ways to share more with my neighb@@ ors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ck@@ ers , st@@ en@@ c@@ ils and ch@@ al@@ k .
and these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighb@@ ors paying for their a@@ part@@ ments ?
how can we l@@ end and bor@@ row more things without kno@@ cking on each other 's doors at a bad time ?
how can we share more of our memories of our ab@@ and@@ oned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
and how can we share more of our ho@@ pes for our vac@@ ant sto@@ re@@ fron@@ ts , so our communities can refle@@ ct our needs and dreams today ?
now , I live in New Or@@ le@@ ans , and I am in love with New Or@@ le@@ ans .
my soul is always so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by the giant live o@@ ak trees , sha@@ ding lo@@ vers , dr@@ un@@ ks and dre@@ am@@ ers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone s@@ nee@@ zes , New Or@@ le@@ ans has a para@@ de .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of ab@@ and@@ oned proper@@ ties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a ni@@ cer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unex@@ pe@@ cted .
and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gra@@ titude for the time I have had , and brought c@@ lar@@ ity to the things that are meani@@ ng@@ ful to my life now .
but I struggle to main@@ tain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it 's easy to get caught up in the da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this ab@@ and@@ oned house into a giant ch@@ al@@ k@@ board and st@@ en@@ c@@ iled it with a fil@@ l-@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ bl@@ ank sentence : " before I die , I want to ... " So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , refle@@ ct on their lives , and share their personal as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions in public space .
I did not know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
and I would like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
" before I die , I want to be tried for p@@ ir@@ acy . "
" before I die , I want to str@@ ad@@ dle the International date L@@ ine . "
" before I die , I want to sing for millions . "
" before I die , I want to plant a tree . "
" before I die , I want to live off the gri@@ d . "
" before I die , I want to hold her one more time . "
" before I die , I want to be someone 's ca@@ val@@ ry . "
" before I die , I want to be completely myself . "
so this ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted space became a constru@@ ctive one , and people 's ho@@ pes and dreams made me laugh out loud , t@@ ear up , and they con@@ so@@ led me during my own tough times .
it 's about knowing you are not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighb@@ ors in new and en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
it 's about making space for refle@@ ction and con@@ temp@@ lation , and rememb@@ ering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started recei@@ ving hundreds of mes@@ sages from pas@@ sionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civi@@ c center colleagues and I made a tool k@@ it , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Ka@@ za@@ kh@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Ar@@ g@@ enti@@ na and beyond .
together , we have shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we are given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
in our age of increasing di@@ str@@ actions , it 's more important than ever to find ways to main@@ tain perspective and remember that life is bri@@ ef and ten@@ der .
death is something that we are often disc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I have realized that prepar@@ ing for death is one of the most em@@ power@@ ing things you can do .
thinking about death c@@ lar@@ i@@ fi@@ es your life .
our shared spaces can better refle@@ ct what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our ho@@ pes , fe@@ ars and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
thank you .
thank you .
so , well , I do appli@@ ed math , and this is a pe@@ cu@@ liar problem for anyone who does appli@@ ed math , is that we are like management con@@ sul@@ t@@ ants .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so I am going to give you some -- attemp@@ t today to try and explain to you what I do .
so , dan@@ cing is one of the most human of activities .
we de@@ light at bal@@ let vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s and ta@@ p dan@@ cers you will see later on .
now , bal@@ let requires an extraordinary level of exper@@ ti@@ se and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initi@@ al su@@ it@@ ability that may well have a genetic compon@@ ent to it .
now , sa@@ dly , neuro@@ logical dis@@ orders such as Par@@ kin@@ son 's disease gradu@@ ally destro@@ y this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing , who was a vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so bal@@ let dan@@ cer in his time .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
however , there are 6 point 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able wea@@ kness , tre@@ m@@ or , ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are obje@@ ctive tools to dete@@ ct the disease before it 's too late .
we need to be able to measure progre@@ ssion obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we are going to know when we actually have a cu@@ re is when we have an obje@@ ctive measure that can answer that for sure .
but fru@@ str@@ ati@@ ngly , with Par@@ kin@@ son 's disease and other movement dis@@ orders , there are no bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers , so there 's no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20@@ -@@ minute neuro@@ logist test .
you have to go to the clin@@ ic to do it . it 's very , very co@@ stly , and that means that , outside the clinical tri@@ als , it 's just never done . it 's never done .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clin@@ ic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
no expensive staff time requi@@ red .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neuro@@ logist 's clin@@ ic to do it .
so what I want to pro@@ pose to you as an un@@ conven@@ tional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s like my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing .
so here we have a video of the vi@@ bra@@ ting vo@@ cal fol@@ ds .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vo@@ cal bal@@ let dan@@ cers , because we have to coordin@@ ate all of these vo@@ cal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
and like bal@@ let , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
from the sound , we can actually track the vo@@ cal fold position as it vi@@ br@@ ates , and just as the li@@ mb@@ s are affected in Par@@ kin@@ son 's , so too are the vo@@ cal organs .
so on the bottom tr@@ ace , you can see an example of ir@@ regular vo@@ cal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
we see all the same symptoms .
we see vo@@ cal tre@@ m@@ or , wea@@ kness and ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity .
the speech actually becomes qui@@ e@@ ter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that 's one of the example symptoms of it .
so these vo@@ cal effects can actually be quite sub@@ tle , in some cases , but with any digital micro@@ phone , and using preci@@ sion voice analysis software in comb@@ ination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advan@@ ced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continu@@ um between health and disease using voice sign@@ als alone .
so these vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ based tests , how do they st@@ ack up against exper@@ t clinical tests ? we ' ll , they are both non-@@ in@@ va@@ sive .
the neuro@@ logist 's test is non-@@ in@@ va@@ sive . they both use existing infrastructure .
you do not have to design a whole new set of hospit@@ als to do it .
and they are both accurate . okay , but in addition , vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ based tests are non-@@ exper@@ t .
that means they can be self-@@ admini@@ ster@@ ed .
they are high-@@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
they are ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
when something becomes ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , it becomes ma@@ ssi@@ vely sc@@ al@@ able .
so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
we can reduce logi@@ sti@@ cal difficul@@ ties with patients .
no need to go to the clin@@ ic for a rou@@ ti@@ ne che@@ ck@@ up .
we can do high-@@ frequ@@ ency monit@@ oring to get obje@@ ctive data .
we can per@@ form low-@@ cost mass re@@ cru@@ it@@ ment for clinical tri@@ als , and we can make popu@@ la@@ tion@@ -@@ scale scre@@ ening f@@ ea@@ sible for the first time .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it 's too late .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we are laun@@ ching the Par@@ kin@@ son 's Vo@@ ice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative .
with A@@ cu@@ lab and Pa@@ ti@@ en@@ t@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e , we are a@@ im@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to t@@ ack@@ le these four goals .
we have local numbers ac@@ ces@@ sible to three quar@@ ters of a billion people on the planet .
anyone healthy or with Par@@ kin@@ son 's can call in , chea@@ ply , and leave recor@@ dings , a few cents each , and I am really happy to announ@@ ce that we have already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
thank you .
so Ma@@ x , by taking all these sa@@ mples of , let 's say , 10000 people , you will be able to tell who 's healthy and who 's not ?
what are you going to get out of those sa@@ mples ?
yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indi@@ cate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
but we will get a very large sa@@ mple of data that is collec@@ ted from all different circum@@ stances , and it 's getting it in different circum@@ stances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ on@@ ing out the con@@ f@@ ounding factors , and looking for the actual mar@@ kers of the disease .
so you are 8@@ 6 percent accurate right now ?
it 's much better than that .
actually , my student Th@@ an@@ as@@ is , I have to plu@@ g him , because he 's done some fantastic work , and now he has pro@@ ved that it works over the mobile tele@@ phone network as well , which en@@ ables this project , and we are getting 99 percent accur@@ acy .
n@@ ine@@ ty-@@ nine . well , that 's an impro@@ vement .
so what that means is that people will be able to — Pe@@ op@@ le will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Par@@ kin@@ son 's could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they are doing in this course of the disease .
absolutely .
thanks so much . Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ tle , everybody .
thanks , Tom .
I live in South C@@ entr@@ al .
this is South C@@ entr@@ al : liqu@@ or sto@@ res , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
so the city plan@@ ners , they get together and they figure they are going to change the name South C@@ entr@@ al to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city .
this is South Los Angeles .
liqu@@ or sto@@ res , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
just like 26 point 5 million other Americans , I live in a food deser@@ t , South C@@ entr@@ al Los Angeles , home of the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ u and the dri@@ ve-@@ by .
funny thing is , the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ us are killing more people than the dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ ys .
people are dying from cur@@ able diseases in South C@@ entr@@ al Los Angeles .
for instance , the obe@@ sity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , B@@ ever@@ ly H@@ ills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
and I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs bought and sold like used cars .
I see di@@ aly@@ sis cen@@ ters pop@@ ping up like St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks .
and I figured , this has to stop .
so I figured that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an app@@ le that was not impre@@ gn@@ ated with pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des .
so what I did , I plan@@ ted a food forest in front of my house .
it was on a stri@@ p of land that we call a par@@ k@@ way .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
thing is , it 's ow@@ ned by the city .
but you have to main@@ tain it .
so I am like , " C@@ ool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it 's my responsibility and I go@@ tta main@@ tain it . "
and this is how I decided to main@@ tain it .
so me and my group , L@@ .@@ A. Gre@@ en gr@@ ounds , we got together and we started plan@@ ting my food forest , fru@@ it trees , you know , the whole nine , vege@@ tables .
what we do , we are a pa@@ y-@@ it@@ -@@ forward kind of group , where it 's com@@ posed of gar@@ den@@ ers from all wal@@ ks of life , from all over the city , and it 's completely volunte@@ er , and everything we do is free .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody compla@@ ined .
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a c@@ itation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this c@@ itation was turning into a war@@ rant .
and I am like , " C@@ ome on , really ?
a war@@ rant for plan@@ ting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? "
and I was like , " C@@ ool . bring it . "
because this time it was not coming up .
so L@@ .@@ A. Times got a@@ hold of it . Steve Lo@@ pe@@ z did a story on it and talked to the coun@@ c@@ il@@ man , and one of the Gre@@ en gr@@ ounds members , they put up a pe@@ ti@@ tion on Ch@@ an@@ ge@@ .@@ or@@ g , and with 9@@ 00 sign@@ atures , we were a success .
we had a vi@@ ctory on our hands .
my coun@@ c@@ il@@ man even called in and said how they end@@ or@@ se and love what we are doing .
I mean , come on , why would not they ?
L@@ .@@ A. leads the United States in vac@@ ant lots that the city actually ow@@ ns .
they own 26 square miles of vac@@ ant lots .
that 's 20 C@@ entr@@ al Par@@ ks .
that 's enough space to plant 7@@ 25 million tom@@ a@@ to plants .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
growing one plant will give you 1000 , 10000 see@@ ds .
when one dollar 's worth of green be@@ ans will give you 75 dollars ' worth of produce .
it 's my go@@ spe@@ l , when I am telling people , grow your own food .
growing your own food is like prin@@ ting your own money .
see , I have a leg@@ acy in South C@@ entr@@ al .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
and I ref@@ use to be a part of this manufactu@@ red reality that was manufactu@@ red for me by some other people , and I am manufacturing my own reality .
see , I am an artist .
gar@@ den@@ ing is my gra@@ ff@@ iti . I grow my art .
just like a gra@@ ff@@ iti artist , where they beauti@@ fy walls , me , I beautiful law@@ ns , par@@ k@@ ways .
I use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of clo@@ th , and the plants and the trees , that 's my em@@ be@@ lli@@ sh@@ ment for that clo@@ th .
you would be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your can@@ v@@ as .
you just could not imagine how amazing a sun@@ flower is and how it affe@@ cts people .
so what happened ?
I have wit@@ ne@@ ssed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transfor@@ mation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the com@@ position of the soil .
we are the soil .
you would be surprised how kids are affected by this .
gar@@ den@@ ing is the most ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do , especially in the in@@ ner city .
plus you get str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my y@@ ard , and I came out and they looked so as@@ ha@@ med .
so I am like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you do not have to do this like this .
this is on the street for a reason .
it made me feel as@@ ha@@ med to see people that were this close to me that were hu@@ ng@@ ry , and this only re@@ infor@@ ced why I do this , and people asked me , " f@@ in , aren ' t you afraid people are going to ste@@ al your food ? "
and I am like , " H@@ ell no , I ain ' t afraid they are gonna ste@@ al it .
that 's why it 's on the street .
that 's the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . "
there 's another time when I put a garden in this home@@ less shel@@ ter in down@@ town Los Angeles .
these are the guys , they helped me un@@ load the tru@@ ck .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
so Gre@@ en gr@@ ounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gar@@ den@@ s .
we have had , like , 50 people come to our dig@@ -@@ ins and particip@@ ate , and it 's all volunte@@ ers .
if kids grow k@@ ale , kids eat k@@ ale .
if they grow tom@@ at@@ oes , they eat tom@@ at@@ oes .
but when none of this is presen@@ ted to them , if they are not shown how food affe@@ cts the mind and the body , they blin@@ dly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they are in this thing where they are caught up -- I see kids of color and they are just on this track that 's designed for them , that leads them to no@@ where .
so with gar@@ den@@ ing , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
and when we do this , who knows ?
we might produce the next George Washington Car@@ ver .
but if we do not change the com@@ position of the soil , we will never do this .
now this is one of my plans . this is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gar@@ den@@ s where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shi@@ pping con@@ tain@@ ers and turn them into healthy ca@@ f@@ es .
now do not get me wrong .
I am not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustain@@ ability , you have to susta@@ in it .
what I am talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and le@@ tting them know the joy , the pri@@ de and the hon@@ or in growing your own food , opening far@@ mer 's markets .
so what I want to do here , we go@@ tta make this se@@ xy .
so I want us all to become eco@@ lu@@ tionary re@@ ne@@ g@@ ad@@ es , g@@ ang@@ st@@ as , g@@ ang@@ st@@ a gar@@ den@@ ers .
we go@@ tta fli@@ p the scri@@ pt on what a g@@ ang@@ st@@ a is .
if you ain ' t a gar@@ den@@ er , you ain ' t g@@ ang@@ st@@ a .
get g@@ ang@@ st@@ a with your sho@@ vel , okay ?
and let that be your weap@@ on of choice .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , do not call me if you want to sit around in cu@@ sh@@ y cha@@ irs and have mee@@ tings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your sho@@ vel so we can plant some shit .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi National Park .
those are my dad 's co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that 's the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi National Park .
N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi National Park is not f@@ enced in the south wi@@ de@@ ly , which means wild animals like ze@@ br@@ as mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the park free@@ ly .
so pre@@ dat@@ ors like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
they kill our li@@ ve@@ stock .
this is one of the co@@ ws which was killed at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had .
my community , the Ma@@ a@@ sai , we believe that we came from hea@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that 's why we value them so much .
so I grew up ha@@ ting lions so much .
the mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who protect our community and the li@@ ve@@ stock , and they are also up@@ set about this problem .
so they kill the lions .
it 's one of the six lions which were killed in N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi .
and I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi National Park lions are few .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad 's co@@ ws , and that 's the same thing which happened to me .
so I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
but I came to realize that that did not really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
so I did not give up . I continued .
and a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ are@@ cro@@ w .
I was trying to trick the lions [ into thinking ] that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
but lions are very cle@@ ver .
they will come the first day and they see the sc@@ are@@ cro@@ w , and they go back , but the second day , they will come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it 's always here .
so he ju@@ mps in and kil@@ ls the animals .
so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions did not come .
and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so I had an idea .
since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom 's new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electr@@ on@@ ics .
so I got an old car bat@@ tery , an indi@@ c@@ ator box . it 's a small device found in a mo@@ tor@@ cycle , and it helps mo@@ tori@@ sts when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
and that 's a small tor@@ ch from a broken fla@@ sh@@ light .
so I set up everything .
as you can see , the solar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ tery , and the bat@@ tery supp@@ lies the power to the small indi@@ c@@ ator box . I call it a transfor@@ mer .
and the indi@@ c@@ ator box makes the lights fla@@ sh .
as you can see , the bul@@ bs face outside , because that 's where the lions come from .
and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night .
the lights fla@@ sh and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
thanks .
so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
and my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
and I said , " Yes . "
so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
since now , I have set up seven homes around my community , and they are really working .
and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ards , and it 's also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ ph@@ ants away from people 's far@@ ms .
because of this inven@@ tion , I was lucky to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ o@@ kh@@ ouse International School , and I am really excited about this .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fun@@ dra@@ i@@ sing and creating an awar@@ eness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we are instal@@ ling the lights to the homes which do not have [ any ] , and I am teaching them how to put them .
so one year ago , I was just a boy in the sa@@ van@@ na gra@@ ss@@ land her@@ ding my father 's co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es flying over , and I told myself that one day , I will be there inside .
and here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
so my big dream is to become an air@@ craft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my inven@@ tion is saving my father 's co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ên . it means in my language , thank you very much .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
so you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship . Y@@ ep .
you are working on other electrical inven@@ tions .
what 's the next one on your list ?
my next inven@@ tion is , I want to make an electric f@@ ence . electric f@@ ence ?
but I know electric f@@ ences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
you already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a sho@@ ck .
in the tr@@ en@@ ches . Richard Tur@@ ere , you are something else .
we are going to che@@ er you on every step of the way , my friend .
thank you so much . thank you .
everything I do , and everything I do profes@@ sion@@ ally -- my life -- has been sha@@ ped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
from 197@@ 1 to 197@@ 7 -- I look young , but I am not — -- I worked in Z@@ am@@ bia , Kenya , I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast , Al@@ g@@ eria , S@@ om@@ alia , in projects of techni@@ cal co@@ operation with African countries .
I worked for an Ital@@ ian N@@ G@@ O , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
and I was di@@ str@@ au@@ ght .
I thought , age 21 , that we Ital@@ i@@ ans were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
instead , everything we tou@@ ched we killed .
our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , " ri@@ pp@@ les from the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i , " was a project where we Ital@@ i@@ ans decided to teach Z@@ ambi@@ an people how to grow food .
so we arrived there with Ital@@ ian see@@ ds in sou@@ thern Z@@ am@@ bia in this absolutely ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cent val@@ ley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i Ri@@ ver , and we taught the local people how to grow Ital@@ ian tom@@ at@@ oes and z@@ u@@ c@@ ch@@ in@@ i and ...
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
and we were ama@@ zed that the local people , in such a fer@@ ti@@ le val@@ ley , would not have any agri@@ culture .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , " Th@@ ank God we are here . "
" just in the ni@@ ck of time to save the Z@@ ambi@@ an people from star@@ vation . "
and of course , everything in Africa grew beauti@@ fully .
we had these ma@@ gni@@ fi@@ cent tom@@ at@@ oes . in Ital@@ y , a tom@@ a@@ to would grow to this size . in Z@@ am@@ bia , to this size .
and we could not believe , and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , " L@@ ook how easy agri@@ culture is . "
when the tom@@ at@@ oes were nice and ri@@ pe and red , over@@ night , some 200 hi@@ p@@ po@@ s came out from the river and they ate everything .
and we said to the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , " My God , the hi@@ p@@ po@@ s ! "
and the Z@@ ambi@@ ans said , " Yes , that 's why we have no agri@@ culture here . "
" why did not you tell us ? " " you never asked . "
I thought it was only us Ital@@ i@@ ans bl@@ under@@ ing around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Z@@ am@@ bia .
because , you see , at least we f@@ ed the hi@@ p@@ po@@ s .
you should see the ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh — -- You should see the ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh that we have be@@ sto@@ wed on un@@ suspe@@ cting African people .
you want to read the book , read " D@@ ead A@@ id , " by D@@ ambi@@ sa Mo@@ yo , Z@@ ambi@@ an woman economi@@ st .
the book was published in 2009 .
we Western don@@ or countries have given the African conti@@ n@@ ent two tril@@ lion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I am not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
just go and read her book .
read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
we Western people are im@@ peri@@ alist , col@@ oni@@ alist mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ aries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : we either pa@@ tr@@ oni@@ ze them , or we are pat@@ er@@ n@@ ali@@ stic .
the two words come from the Latin root " p@@ ater , " which means " father . "
but they mean two different things .
P@@ at@@ er@@ n@@ ali@@ stic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . " I love you so much . "
pa@@ tr@@ oni@@ zing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my ser@@ v@@ ants .
that 's why the white people in Africa are called " b@@ wan@@ a , " boss .
I was given a sla@@ p in the face reading a book , " S@@ m@@ all is B@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful , " written by S@@ chu@@ mach@@ er , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
this should be the first prin@@ ciple of aid .
the first prin@@ ciple of aid is respect .
this morning , the gentle@@ man who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , " C@@ an we -- can you imagine a city that is not ne@@ o@@ col@@ oni@@ al ? "
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se F@@ aci@@ li@@ tation , where you never initi@@ ate anything , you never moti@@ vate anybody , but you become a ser@@ v@@ ant of the local passion , the ser@@ v@@ ant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
so what you do -- you shut up .
you never arri@@ ve in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
we do not work from offi@@ ces .
we meet at the ca@@ fe . we meet at the pu@@ b .
we have zero infrastructure .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
the most important thing is passion .
you can give somebody an idea .
if that person does not want to do it , what are you going to do ?
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succe@@ ed alone .
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
so years and years ago , I had this idea : why do not we , for once , instead of arri@@ ving in the community to tell people what to do , why do not , for once , listen to them ? but not in community mee@@ tings .
let me tell you a secret .
there is a problem with community mee@@ tings .
entrepre@@ neur@@ s never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identi@@ fied .
so planning has this blind spot .
the smar@@ test people in your community you do not even know , because they do not come to your public mee@@ tings .
what we do , we work one-@@ on-@@ one , and to work one-@@ on-@@ one , you have to create a social infrastructure that does not exist .
you have to create a new profes@@ sion .
the profes@@ sion is the family doctor of enter@@ pri@@ se , the family doctor of business , who s@@ its with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the ca@@ fe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tr@@ y@@ out in E@@ sper@@ ance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph@@ .@@ D. at the time , trying to go away from this pa@@ tr@@ oni@@ zing bul@@ l@@ shit that we arri@@ ve and tell you what to do .
and so what I did in E@@ sper@@ ance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first cli@@ ent , and I helped this first guy who was smo@@ king fish from a gar@@ age , was a Ma@@ or@@ i guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Per@@ th , to get organized , and then the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men came to me to say , " You the guy who helped Ma@@ or@@ i ? can you help us ? "
and I helped these five fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men to work together and get this beautiful tu@@ na not to the can@@ ner@@ y in Al@@ b@@ any for 60 cents a kil@@ o , but we found a way to take the fish for su@@ sh@@ i to Japan for 15 dollars a kil@@ o , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , " Hey , you helped them . can you help us ? "
in a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , " How can you do that ?
how can you do — ? " and I said , " I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . "
so — — So the government says , " Do it again . "
we have done it in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped to start 4@@ 0000 businesses .
there is a new generation of entrepre@@ neur@@ s who are dying of soli@@ tu@@ de .
Peter D@@ ru@@ cker , one of the greatest management con@@ sul@@ t@@ ants in history , died age 9@@ 6 , a few years ago .
Peter D@@ ru@@ cker was a professor of philosoph@@ y before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter D@@ ru@@ cker says : " planning is actually in@@ com@@ pati@@ ble with an entrepre@@ neu@@ ri@@ al society and economy . "
planning is the ki@@ ss of death of entrepre@@ neur@@ ship .
so now you are re@@ building Christ@@ chur@@ ch without knowing what the smar@@ test people in Christ@@ chur@@ ch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
you have to offer them confi@@ d@@ enti@@ ality , pri@@ v@@ acy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in dro@@ ves .
in a community of 10000 people , we get 200 cli@@ ents .
can you imagine a community of 4@@ 00000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
which presen@@ tation have you app@@ lau@@ ded the most this morning ?
local , pas@@ sionate people . that 's who you have app@@ lau@@ ded .
so what I am saying is that entrepre@@ neur@@ ship is where it 's at .
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non@@ re@@ new@@ able fo@@ ssi@@ l fu@@ els , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
the inter@@ nal com@@ bu@@ s@@ tion engine is not sustainable .
Fre@@ on way of main@@ ta@@ ining things is not sustainable .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cu@@ re , edu@@ cate , transp@@ ort , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
who is going to inv@@ ent the technology for the green revolution ? univer@@ si@@ ties ? forget about it !
government ? forget about it !
it will be entrepre@@ neur@@ s , and they are doing it now .
there 's a lo@@ vely story that I read in a fu@@ tu@@ ri@@ st magazine many , many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discu@@ ss the future of the city of New York in 18@@ 60 .
and in 18@@ 60 , this group of people came together , and they all spe@@ cul@@ ated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclu@@ sion was un@@ ani@@ mous : the city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
why ? because they looked at the cur@@ ve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million hor@@ ses , and the man@@ ure created by six million hor@@ ses would be impossible to deal with .
they were already dro@@ w@@ ning in man@@ ure .
so 18@@ 60 , they are seeing this dir@@ ty technology that is going to cho@@ ke the life out of New York .
so what happens ? in 40 years ' time , in the year 19@@ 00 , in the United States of America , there were 10@@ 01 car manufacturing companies -- 10@@ 01 .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little fact@@ ories in back@@ wat@@ ers .
D@@ ear@@ born , Mi@@ chi@@ gan . Hen@@ ry For@@ d .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepre@@ neur@@ s .
first , you have to offer them confi@@ d@@ enti@@ ality .
otherwise they do not come and talk to you .
then you have to offer them absolute , de@@ di@@ cated , pas@@ sionate service to them .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepre@@ neur@@ ship .
the sm@@ alle@@ st company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beauti@@ fully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
guess what ?
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
it does not exist .
this person has never been born .
we have done the research , and we have looked at the 100 i@@ con@@ ic companies of the world -- Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e , W@@ esti@@ ngh@@ ouse , E@@ di@@ son , For@@ d , all the new companies , Google , Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : none were started by one person .
now we teach entrepre@@ neur@@ ship to 16@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds in Nor@@ thu@@ mb@@ er@@ land , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard B@@ ran@@ son 's au@@ to@@ bio@@ graphy , and the task of the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds is to under@@ line , in the first two pages of Richard B@@ ran@@ son 's au@@ to@@ bio@@ graphy how many times Richard uses the word " I " and how many times he uses the word " we . "
never the word " I , " and the word " we " 32 times .
he was not alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
so we can create the community where we have facili@@ t@@ ators who come from a small business background sitting in ca@@ f@@ es , in b@@ ars , and your de@@ di@@ cated bud@@ dies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentle@@ man who talks about this epi@@ c , somebody who will say to you , " What do you need ?
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? "

we acti@@ vate communities .
we have groups of volunte@@ ers suppor@@ ting the En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se facili@@ t@@ ator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the mi@@ rac@@ le of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by cap@@ tur@@ ing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .

before March , 2011 , I was a photo@@ graphic re@@ tou@@ cher based in New York City .
we are p@@ ale , gr@@ ay creatures .
we hi@@ de in dark , win@@ dow@@ less rooms , and generally avoid sun@@ light .
we make sk@@ in@@ ny models sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get cri@@ tici@@ zed in the press all the time , but some of us are actually tal@@ en@@ ted artists with years of experience and a real appreci@@ ation for images and photograph@@ y .
on March 11 , 2011 , I watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tra@@ gic events un@@ fol@@ ded in Japan .
soon after , an organization I volunte@@ er with , A@@ ll H@@ ands V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response effor@@ ts .
I , along with hundreds of other volunte@@ ers , knew we could not just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
on May the 13@@ th , I made my way to the town of Ō@@ fun@@ a@@ to .
it 's a small fi@@ shing town in I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ fe@@ cture , about 5@@ 0000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
the wat@@ ers here have been recor@@ ded at rea@@ ching over 24 meters in he@@ ight , and travel@@ ed over two miles in@@ land .
as you can imagine , the town had been de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
we pulled de@@ br@@ is from can@@ als and d@@ it@@ ches .
we clean@@ ed schools . we de-@@ mu@@ d@@ ded and gu@@ t@@ ted homes ready for re@@ no@@ vation and re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation .
we clear@@ ed tons and tons of stin@@ king , ro@@ tting fish car@@ ca@@ sses from the local fish proces@@ sing plant .
we got dir@@ ty , and we loved it .
for weeks , all the volunte@@ ers and lo@@ cals ali@@ ke had been finding similar things .
they would been finding photos and photo al@@ bu@@ ms and camer@@ as and S@@ D cards .
and everyone was doing the same .
they were collec@@ ting them up , and h@@ anding them in to various places around the different to@@ w@@ ns for safe@@ keeping .
now , it was not until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
as they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
at the end of my first week there , I found myself helping out in an ev@@ acu@@ ation center in the town .
I was helping clean the on@@ sen , the commu@@ nal on@@ sen , the huge giant ba@@ th@@ tu@@ bs .
this happened to also be a place in the town where the ev@@ acu@@ ation center was collec@@ ting the photos .
this is where people were h@@ anding them in , and I was hon@@ o@@ red that day that they actually tru@@ sted me to help them start hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing them .
now , it was emotional and it was in@@ spir@@ ing , and I have always heard about thinking outside the box , but it was not until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
as I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the en@@ velo@@ pe from the proces@@ sing lab , I could not help but think as a re@@ tou@@ cher that I could fix that t@@ ear and m@@ end that sc@@ r@@ atch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
so that evening , I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming and so positive , I knew we had to give it a go .
so we started re@@ tou@@ ching photos .
this was the very first .
not terri@@ bly dama@@ ged , but where the water had caused that dis@@ col@@ or@@ ation on the girl 's face had to be re@@ pa@@ i@@ red with such accur@@ acy and deli@@ c@@ acy .
otherwise , that little girl is not going to look like that little girl anymore , and su@@ rely that 's as tra@@ gic as having the photo dama@@ ged .
over time , more photos came in , than@@ k@@ fully , and more re@@ tou@@ ch@@ ers were needed , and so I reached out again on Facebook and Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
within two weeks , I had 150 people wan@@ ting to join in .
within Japan , by Ju@@ ly , we would bran@@ ched out to the neighbor@@ ing town of Ri@@ ku@@ z@@ en@@ ta@@ k@@ ata , further north to a town called Y@@ ama@@ da .
once a week , we would set up our sc@@ an@@ ning equipment in the tempor@@ ary photo libr@@ aries that had been set up , where people were re@@ cla@@ im@@ ing their photos .
the older ladies sometimes hadn ' t seen a sc@@ an@@ ner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it sc@@ an@@ ned , up@@ lo@@ aded to a cloud ser@@ ver , it would be down@@ lo@@ aded by a ga@@ i@@ jin , a str@@ anger , somewhere on the other side of the glo@@ be , and it would start being fixed .
the time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depen@@ ded obviously on the damage involved .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
it could take months .
the ki@@ mon@@ o in this shot pretty much had to be hand@@ -@@ dra@@ wn , or pie@@ ced together , pic@@ king out the rema@@ ining parts of color and detail that the water hadn ' t dama@@ ged .
it was very ti@@ me@@ -@@ consu@@ ming .
now , all these photos had been dama@@ ged by water , sub@@ mer@@ ged in sal@@ t water , covered in bacteria , in se@@ w@@ age , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing them was a huge part of the project .
we could not re@@ touch the photo unless it was clean@@ ed , dry and re@@ cla@@ im@@ ed .
now , we were lucky with our hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing .
we had an amazing local woman who gui@@ ded us .
it 's very easy to do more damage to those dama@@ ged photos .
as my team leader W@@ y@@ n@@ ne once said , it 's like doing a t@@ at@@ too on someone .
you do not get a chance to m@@ ess it up .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
she had started hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
she also had du@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ ates .
areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and re@@ make the whole photo .
when she collec@@ ted the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the de@@ br@@ is a long way from where the home had once stood , and they would recogni@@ zed him .
the day of the t@@ sun@@ ami , he would actually been in charge of making sure the t@@ sun@@ ami g@@ ates were closed .
he had to go towards the water as the si@@ re@@ ns s@@ ounded .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
one of them got caught up in the water .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survi@@ ved .
the day I gave her the photos also happened to be her you@@ ng@@ est son 's 14@@ th birthday .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he rememb@@ ered from before that was not still scar@@ red from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destro@@ yed .
after six months in Japan , 1@@ 100 volunte@@ ers had passed through A@@ ll H@@ ands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand@@ -@@ clean over 13@@ 5000 photograph@@ s , the large majority a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
over five hundred volunte@@ ers around the glo@@ be helped us get 90 families hundreds of photograph@@ s back , fully re@@ sto@@ red and re@@ tou@@ ched .
during this time , we hadn ' t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was prin@@ ter in@@ ks .
we take photos constantly .
a photo is a re@@ min@@ der of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
they are our me@@ mor@@ y-@@ kee@@ pers and our hi@@ stories , the last thing we would gra@@ b and the first thing you would go back to look for .
that 's all this project was about , about re@@ stor@@ ing those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
when a photo like this can be re@@ turned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person recei@@ ving it .
the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the re@@ tou@@ ch@@ ers .
for some of them , it 's given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their tal@@ ents on something other than sk@@ in@@ ny models and perfect skin .
I would like to conclu@@ de by reading an email I got from one of them , C@@ in@@ dy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
" as I worked , I could not help but think about the individuals and the stories represen@@ ted in the images .
one in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gather@@ ed around a baby , stru@@ ck a ch@@ ord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and new@@ born daughter , h@@ ang@@ s on our wall .
across the glo@@ be , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren ' t they ? "
thank you .
I am 150 feet down an il@@ legal mine sha@@ ft in Gh@@ ana .
the air is thi@@ ck with heat and du@@ st , and it 's hard to brea@@ the .
I can feel the bru@@ sh of swe@@ at@@ y bodies pas@@ sing me in the dar@@ kness , but I can ' t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the sha@@ ft is this c@@ ac@@ o@@ ph@@ ony of men cou@@ gh@@ ing , and stone being broken with pri@@ mi@@ tive tools .
like the others , I wear a fli@@ ck@@ ering , cheap fla@@ sh@@ light ti@@ ed to my head with this el@@ as@@ tic , t@@ at@@ tered band , and I can b@@ arely make out the sli@@ ck tree li@@ mb@@ s holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dro@@ pping hundreds of feet into the earth .
when my hand sli@@ ps , I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lost his gri@@ p and fell coun@@ t@@ less feet down that sha@@ ft .
as I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , ri@@ s@@ king their lives without pay@@ ment or comp@@ en@@ sation , and often dying .
I got to cli@@ mb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they are tra@@ pped in sla@@ very .
for the last 28 years , I have been docu@@ men@@ ting indi@@ gen@@ ous cul@@ tures in more than 70 countries on six conti@@ n@@ ents , and in 2009 I had the great hon@@ or of being the so@@ le ex@@ hi@@ bit@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver Pe@@ ace Su@@ m@@ mit .
a@@ mo@@ ng@@ st all the ast@@ oni@@ shing people I met there , I met a suppor@@ ter of F@@ ree the sla@@ ves , an N@@ G@@ O de@@ di@@ cated to er@@ a@@ di@@ cating modern day sla@@ very .
we started talking about sla@@ very , and really , I started learning about sla@@ very , for I had certainly known it exi@@ sted in the world , but not to such a degree .
after we finished talking , I felt so horri@@ ble and hone@@ stly as@@ ha@@ med at my own lack of knowledge of this a@@ tro@@ city in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I do not know , how many other people do not know ?
it started burning a hole in my stom@@ ach , so within weeks , I fle@@ w down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of F@@ ree the sla@@ ves and offer them my help .
th@@ us began my journey into modern day sla@@ very .
o@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before .
some I even considered like my second home .
but this time , I would see the ske@@ let@@ ons hidden in the clo@@ set .
a conser@@ vative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people en@@ sla@@ ved in the world today .
that 's double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic sla@@ ve trade .
a hundred and fif@@ ty years ago , an agri@@ cultural sla@@ ve cost about three times the an@@ nu@@ al sal@@ ary of an American wor@@ ker .
that equ@@ ates to about $ 5@@ 0000 in today 's money .
yet today , entire families can be en@@ sla@@ ved for gener@@ ations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
ast@@ oni@@ shi@@ ngly , sla@@ very gener@@ ates prof@@ its of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
many have been tri@@ cked by fal@@ se promi@@ ses of a good education , a better job , only to find that they are forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
today 's sla@@ very is about commer@@ ce , so the goods that en@@ sla@@ ved people produce have value , but the people producing them are dis@@ po@@ sa@@ ble .
sla@@ very exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ legal everywhere in the world .
in India and Ne@@ p@@ al , I was introduced to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns .
this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egy@@ pt or D@@ an@@ te 's inf@@ er@@ no .
en@@ velo@@ ped in temper@@ atures of 1@@ 30 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were clo@@ a@@ ked in a heavy b@@ lan@@ ket of du@@ st , while me@@ chan@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ rying them from the sc@@ or@@ ching kil@@ ns to tru@@ cks hundreds of y@@ ards away .
de@@ ad@@ ened by mon@@ o@@ t@@ ony and ex@@ ha@@ u@@ s@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
there were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the severe de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ consequ@@ ential .
so per@@ va@@ sive was the heat and the du@@ st that my camera became too hot to even touch and c@@ ea@@ sed working .
every 20 minutes , I would have to run back to our cru@@ is@@ er to clean out my g@@ ear and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
back in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cry , but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , " L@@ is@@ a , do not do that . just do not do that here . "
and he very clearly explained to me that emotional disp@@ la@@ ys are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I could not offer them any direct help .
I could not give them money , nothing .
I was not a citiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I would have to rely on F@@ ree the sla@@ ves to work within the system for their liber@@ ation , and I tru@@ sted that they would .
as for me , I would have to wait until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ break .
in the H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ as , I found children car@@ rying stone for miles down moun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ rain to tru@@ cks waiting at ro@@ ads below .
the big she@@ ets of s@@ late were hea@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ rying them , and the kids ho@@ i@@ sted them from their heads using these hand@@ made har@@ ne@@ sses of sti@@ cks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n clo@@ th .
it 's difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
how can we affect something so insi@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ va@@ sive ?
some do not even know they are en@@ sla@@ ved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
they have nothing to compare it to .
when these villa@@ gers cla@@ im@@ ed their freedom , the sla@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center r@@ al@@ lied for them to per@@ severe , and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ i@@ sts on the ground helped them get a quar@@ ry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
sex traf@@ fi@@ cking is what we often think of when we hear the word sla@@ very , and because of this worldwide awar@@ eness , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work safe@@ ly within this particular industry .
in Ka@@ th@@ m@@ and@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had previ@@ ously been sex sla@@ ves themselves .
they u@@ sh@@ ered me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ irs that led to this dir@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ ore@@ scent lit ba@@ se@@ ment .
this was not a bro@@ the@@ l , per se .
it was more like a restaurant .
ca@@ bin restau@@ ran@@ ts , as they are known in the trade , are venu@@ es for forced pro@@ stitu@@ tion .
each has small , private rooms , where the sla@@ ves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to enter@@ tain the cli@@ ents , encoura@@ ging them to buy more food and alcoho@@ l .
each cu@@ bi@@ cle is dark and di@@ ng@@ y , identi@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the wall , and parti@@ tioned by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ tain .
the workers here often en@@ du@@ re tra@@ gic sexual abu@@ se at the hands of their customers .
standing in the near dar@@ kness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tra@@ pped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the sta@@ irs from where I would come in .
there were no back doors .
there were no win@@ dows large enough to cli@@ mb through .
these people have no es@@ cape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it 's important to note that sla@@ very , including sex traf@@ fi@@ cking , occur@@ s in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well .
tens of hundreds of people are en@@ sla@@ ved in agri@@ culture , in restau@@ ran@@ ts , in dom@@ es@@ tic ser@@ vit@@ u@@ de , and the list can go on .
recently , the New York Times reported that between 10@@ 0000 and 3@@ 00000 American children are sold into sex sla@@ very every year .
it 's all around us . we just do not see it .
the tex@@ ti@@ le industry is another one we often think of when we hear about sla@@ ve labor .
I vis@@ ited villa@@ ges in India where entire families were en@@ sla@@ ved in the sil@@ k trade .
this is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
the d@@ yed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
they mix d@@ ye in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the liqu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ ye is to@@ xi@@ c .
my interpre@@ ter told me their stories .
" we have no freedom , " they said .
" we hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our d@@ ye@@ ing . "
it 's estim@@ ated that more than 4@@ 000 children are en@@ sla@@ ved on La@@ ke V@@ ol@@ ta , the largest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world .
when we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fi@@ shing on a boat , two older bro@@ thers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
wrong . they were all en@@ sla@@ ved .
children are taken from their families and traf@@ fi@@ cked and v@@ ani@@ shed , and they are forced to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to swi@@ m .
this young child is eight years old .
he was tre@@ mb@@ ling when our boat approa@@ ched , fri@@ ghten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e .
he was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ cked in the water .
the ske@@ le@@ tal tree li@@ mb@@ s sub@@ mer@@ ged in La@@ ke V@@ ol@@ ta often catch the fi@@ shing ne@@ ts , and wear@@ y , fri@@ ghten@@ ed children are thro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lines .
many of them dro@@ wn .
for as long as he can re@@ call , he 's been forced to work on the la@@ ke .
terri@@ fied of his master , he will not run away , and since he 's been treated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the younger sla@@ ves that he man@@ ages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were ha@@ u@@ ling in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m.
in the cold , win@@ dy night .
and it 's important to note that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thousand pounds when they are full of fish .
I want to introduce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was rescu@@ ed from a fi@@ shing village .
I met him at a shel@@ ter where F@@ ree the sla@@ ves re@@ ha@@ bili@@ t@@ ates victims of sla@@ very .
here he 's seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , p@@ our@@ ing big bu@@ cke@@ ts of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what 's even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possibility .
who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
driving down a road in Gh@@ ana with part@@ ners of F@@ ree the sla@@ ves , a fellow abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a m@@ op@@ ed suddenly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ is@@ er and ta@@ pped on the window .
he told us to follow him down a dir@@ t road into the ju@@ ng@@ le .
at the end of the road , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
then he pointed toward this b@@ arely visible foot@@ path , and said , " This is the path , this is the path . go . "
as we started down the path , we pu@@ shed a@@ side the v@@ ines blo@@ cking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the tra@@ il had become f@@ loo@@ ded by recent ra@@ ins , so I ho@@ i@@ sted the photo g@@ ear above my head as we de@@ scen@@ ded into these wat@@ ers up to my chest .
after another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ rup@@ tly ended at a clear@@ ing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a foot@@ ball field , and all of them were full of en@@ sla@@ ved people labor@@ ing .
many women had children str@@ app@@ ed to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for gold , w@@ ading in water po@@ is@@ oned by mer@@ cu@@ ry .
Mer@@ cu@@ ry is used in the ex@@ tr@@ action process .
these min@@ ers are en@@ sla@@ ved in a mine sha@@ ft in another part of Gh@@ ana .
when they came out of the sha@@ ft , they were so@@ a@@ king we@@ t from their own swe@@ at .
I remember looking into their tired , bloo@@ d@@ shot eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 72 hours .
the sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy b@@ ag@@ s of stone that later will be transp@@ or@@ ted to another area , where the stone will be p@@ ounded so that they can ex@@ tract the gold .
at first gl@@ ance , the p@@ ounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortun@@ ate working on the fri@@ ng@@ es , and children too .
all of them are vi@@ c@@ tim to inju@@ ry , illness and violence .
in fact , it 's very likely that this mu@@ scu@@ lar person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mer@@ cu@@ ry po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years .
this is Man@@ ur@@ u . when his father died , his un@@ cle traf@@ fi@@ cked him to work with him in the min@@ es .
when his un@@ cle died , Man@@ ur@@ u inh@@ er@@ ited his un@@ cle 's debt , which further forced him into being en@@ sla@@ ved in the min@@ es .
when I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 14 years , and the leg inju@@ ry that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ated .
on top of that , Man@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , yet he 's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine sha@@ ft .
even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become edu@@ cated with the help of local activi@@ sts like F@@ ree the sla@@ ves , and it 's this sort of determin@@ ation , in the face of un@@ imag@@ in@@ able od@@ ds , that fil@@ ls me with complete a@@ we .
I want to sh@@ ine a light on sla@@ very .
when I was working in the field , I brought lots of c@@ and@@ les with me , and with the help of my interpre@@ ter , I imp@@ ar@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to illu@@ minate their stories and their p@@ light , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ aring wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to to@@ ler@@ ate a@@ tro@@ cities like sla@@ very .
these images are not of issues . they are of people , real people , like you and me , all deser@@ ving of the same rights , dig@@ nity and respect in their lives .
there is not a day that goes by that I do not think of these many beautiful , mi@@ stre@@ ated people I have had the tremendous hon@@ or of meeting .
I hope that these images a@@ wa@@ ken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ig@@ n@@ ite a fire , and that fire will sh@@ ine a light on sla@@ very , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the sha@@ dows .
thank you very much .

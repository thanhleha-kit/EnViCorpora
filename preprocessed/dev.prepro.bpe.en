how can I speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three gener@@ ations , about how the ast@@ oni@@ shing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the China Se@@ a more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzz@@ le still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life 's work .
he is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ an@@ ced on the single hope of his country 's un@@ ity and freedom .
imagine him as the communi@@ sts enter S@@ aig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
he re@@ treated into silence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cru@@ sh us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
my mother , M@@ ai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arr@@ ang@@ ed marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had di@@ sti@@ l@@ led itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in Australia .
it was in@@ con@@ cei@@ v@@ able to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
so after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fi@@ ction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gui@@ sed as a fi@@ shing ves@@ sel .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of p@@ ir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of po@@ i@@ son .
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
my first memories are from the boat -- the stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the bo@@ w di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty h@@ ori@@ zon .
I do not remember the p@@ ir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
but I do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the M@@ ala@@ ysi@@ an co@@ ast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey 's end too much for him , and the first app@@ le I ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
no app@@ le has ever ta@@ sted the same .
after three months in a refu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ mp , we lan@@ ded in M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three gener@@ ations sha@@ ping a new life together .
we sett@@ led in F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ray , a wor@@ ki@@ ng-@@ class su@@ bur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ants .
un@@ like the sett@@ led mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class su@@ bur@@ bs , whose exist@@ ence I was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ tle@@ ment in F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ray .
the sm@@ el@@ ls from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
and the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car asse@@ mb@@ ly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ cations .
we were poor .
all the dollars were al@@ lo@@ cated and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathema@@ tics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for regar@@ d@@ less of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
two pa@@ irs of sto@@ c@@ ki@@ ngs for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ k@@ les , because it had to last for six years .
and there were rare but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of " sli@@ t-@@ eye " and the occa@@ sional gra@@ ff@@ iti : " A@@ sian , go home . "
go home to where ?
something sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me .
there was a gather@@ ing of re@@ solve and a quiet voice saying , " I will by@@ pass you . "
my mother , my sister and I sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and list@@ ened to the mo@@ vements of my grandmother around the house .
my mother suffer@@ ed from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so I could wake her .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transi@@ tion , angry and inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , and trou@@ b@@ led children caught between two worl@@ ds .
gr@@ ants and spon@@ s@@ ors were s@@ ought .
cen@@ ters were estab@@ li@@ shed .
I lived in paralle@@ l worl@@ ds .
in one , I was the classi@@ c A@@ sian student , re@@ len@@ t@@ less in the deman@@ ds that I made on myself .
in the other , I was en@@ me@@ shed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally scar@@ red by violence , drug abu@@ se and i@@ so@@ lation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was cho@@ sen as the young Austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
and I was cat@@ a@@ pul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges did not fit .
T@@ an L@@ e , an@@ on@@ y@@ mous F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ray resident , was now T@@ an L@@ e , refu@@ ge@@ e and social activi@@ st , invited to speak in venu@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose exist@@ ence she could never have imag@@ ined .
I did not know the proto@@ co@@ ls .
I did not know how to use the cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery .
I did not know how to talk about wine .
I did not know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfor@@ t of life in an un@@ sung su@@ bur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I could not do it .
she re@@ min@@ ded me that I was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
no had never been an op@@ tion .
" just do it , " she said , " and do not be what you are not . "
so I spoke out on you@@ th une@@ mp@@ loy@@ ment and education and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and the di@@ sen@@ fran@@ chi@@ sed .
and the more candi@@ dly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
and even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not se@@ ttle into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
and I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be than@@ k@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
I have ste@@ pped outside my comfor@@ t zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possi@@ bilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
there was an energy there , an imp@@ l@@ ac@@ able optimi@@ sm , a strange mi@@ x@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and dar@@ ing .
so I followed my hun@@ ches .
I gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the la@@ bel " It can ' t be done " was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
at the end of each day , I made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
my hun@@ ches again .
three months later I had re@@ lo@@ cated , and the ad@@ ven@@ ture has continued .
before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ani@@ sm was the social nor@@ m and the local M@@ and@@ ar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
life hadn ' t changed for cen@@ tu@@ ries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a M@@ and@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to court and pro@@ secu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
" it can ' t be done " was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in Sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
I looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say good@@ bye .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st te@@ mple in F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her ca@@ s@@ ket .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the ca@@ s@@ ket .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , " Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? "
" because you have been holding it since this morning , " he said .
" you have not let it go . "
if there is a sin@@ ew in our family , it runs through the women .
given who we were and how life had sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
defe@@ at would have come too easily .
now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet I am afraid of pri@@ vi@@ lege , of ea@@ se , of enti@@ tle@@ ment .
can I give them a bo@@ w in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the vast h@@ ori@@ zon that guar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
I do not know .
but if I could give it and still see them safe@@ ly through , I would .
and also , T@@ an 's mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
well this is a really extraordinary hon@@ or for me .
I spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pri@@ sons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there 's a great deal of hope@@ less@@ ness .
and being here at TED and seeing the sti@@ mu@@ lation , hearing it , has been very , very ener@@ gi@@ zing to me .
and one of the things that 's emer@@ ged in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it does not have when it does not .
and I men@@ tion that because I think identity is really important .
and we have had some fantastic presen@@ tations .
and I think what we have learned is that , if you are a teacher your words can be meani@@ ng@@ ful , but if you are a compas@@ sionate teacher , they can be especially meani@@ ng@@ ful .
if you are a doctor you can do some good things , but if you are a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
and so I want to talk about the power of identity .
and I did not learn about this actually pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American home that was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and that matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
her parents were born in sla@@ very in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a in the 18@@ 40 's .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 's and the experience of sla@@ very very much sha@@ ped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
when I would see her as a little boy , she would come up to me and she would give me these hu@@ gs .
and she would squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze me so ti@@ ght I could b@@ arely brea@@ the and then she would let me go .
and an hour or two later , if I saw her , she would come over to me and she would say , " B@@ r@@ yan , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? "
and if I said , " No , " she would assa@@ ult me again , and if I said , " Yes , " she would leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the you@@ ng@@ est of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cou@@ sin@@ s would be running around everywhere .
and I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ sin@@ s were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
and at first I thought we were playing a game .
and I would look at her and I would smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , " C@@ ome on , B@@ r@@ yan . you and I are going to have a talk . "
and I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , " B@@ r@@ yan , I am going to tell you something , but you do not tell anybody what I tell you . "
I said , " Okay , M@@ ama . "
she said , " No@@ w you make sure you do not do that . " I said , " Su@@ re . "
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , " I want you to know I have been watching you . "
and she said , " I think you are special . "
she said , " I think you can do anything you want to do . "
I will never forget it .
and then she said , " I just need you to promise me three things , B@@ r@@ yan . "
I said , " Okay , M@@ ama . "
she said , " The first thing I want you to promise me is that you will always love your mom . "
she said , " That 's my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you will always take care of her . "
well I a@@ do@@ red my mom , so I said , " Yes , M@@ ama . I will do that . "
then she said , " The second thing I want you to promise me is that you will always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . "
and I thought about it and I said , " Yes , M@@ ama . I will do that . "
then finally she said , " The third thing I want you to promise me is that you will never drink alcoho@@ l . "
well I was nine years old , so I said , " Yes , M@@ ama . I will do that . "
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this si@@ x-@@ pack of be@@ er -- I do not know where he got it -- and he gr@@ ab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the woo@@ ds .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ z@@ ily did .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offer@@ ed it to me .
I said , " No , no , no . that 's okay . you all go ahead . I am not going to have any be@@ er . "
my brother said , " C@@ ome on . we are doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . "
I said , " No , I do not feel right about that . Y ' all go ahead . Y ' all go ahead . "
and then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
he said , " What 's wrong with you ? have some be@@ er . "
then he looked at me real hard and he said , " Oh , I hope you are not still hung up on that conversation M@@ ama had with you . "
I said , " Well , what are you talking about ? "
he said , " Oh , M@@ ama tells all the grand@@ kids that they are special . "
I was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
and I am going to ad@@ mit something to you .
I am going to tell you something I probably should not .
I know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
but I am 5@@ 2 years old , and I am going to ad@@ mit to you that I have never had a drop of alcoho@@ l .
I do not say that because I think that 's vir@@ tu@@ ous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they do not actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they do not think they can do .
when I thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
my grandfather was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my male un@@ cles died of alcoho@@ l-@@ related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to comm@@ it to .
well I have been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 00000 people in ja@@ ils and pri@@ sons .
today , there are 2 point 3 million .
the United States now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
we have seven million people on proba@@ tion and par@@ o@@ le .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my ju@@ dg@@ ment , has fundamen@@ tally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this desp@@ air , there is this hope@@ less@@ ness , that is being sha@@ ped by these out@@ comes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on proba@@ tion or par@@ o@@ le .
in urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a , Bal@@ ti@@ more , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on proba@@ tion or par@@ o@@ le .
our system is not just being sha@@ ped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they are also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you are rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you are poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not cul@@ pa@@ bility , sha@@ pes out@@ comes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we have been dis@@ connected .
it 's interesting to me .
we are looking at some very interesting develo@@ p@@ ments in our work .
my state of Al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually per@@ man@@ ently di@@ sen@@ fran@@ chi@@ ses you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vi@@ ction .
right now in Al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has per@@ man@@ ently lost the right to vote .
we are actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of di@@ sen@@ fran@@ chi@@ se@@ ment will be as high as it 's been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vo@@ ting Ri@@ ghts A@@ ct .
and there is this st@@ un@@ ning silence .
I represent children .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
we have life imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this country .
and we are actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
the only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
it 's interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in many ways , we have been taught to think that the real question is , do people de@@ serve to die for the cri@@ mes they have commit@@ ted ?
and that 's a very sen@@ sible question .
but there 's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people de@@ serve to die for the cri@@ mes they comm@@ it , but do we de@@ serve to kill ?
I mean , it 's fascinating .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in America is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been execu@@ ted , we have actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who 's been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
a kind of ast@@ oni@@ shing error rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
I mean , it 's fascinating .
in a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ plan@@ es if for every nine plan@@ es that took off one would cra@@ sh .
but somehow we can insul@@ ate ourselves from this problem .
it 's not our problem .
it 's not our bur@@ den .
it 's not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we de@@ serve to kill .
and it 's interesting , when I teach my students about Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American history , I tell them about sla@@ very .
I tell them about terrori@@ sm , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to World War I@@ I@@ .
we do not really know very much about it .
but for Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
it was the threat of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , " Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we are dealing with terrori@@ sm for the first time in our nation 's history after 9@@ /@@ 11 . "
they tell me to say , " No , tell them that we grew up with that . "
and that era of terrori@@ sm , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of r@@ aci@@ al su@@ bor@@ din@@ ation and a@@ par@@ the@@ id .
and yet , we have in this country this dyna@@ mic where we really do not like to talk about our problems .
we do not like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really have not understood what it 's meant to do the things we have done hi@@ stor@@ ically .
we are constantly running into each other .
we are constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it 's because we are un@@ willing to comm@@ it ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in South Africa , people understood that we could not over@@ come a@@ par@@ the@@ id without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in Rw@@ anda , even after the gen@@ o@@ cide , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we have not done that .
I was giving some lec@@ tures in Germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the presen@@ tation and said , " Well you know it 's deeply trou@@ b@@ ling to hear what you are talking about . "
he said , " We do not have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany . "
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , " T@@ here 's no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syste@@ matic killing of human beings .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about execu@@ ting people . "
and I thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was execu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately Je@@ wish ?
I could not bear it .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the O@@ ld South , we execu@@ te people -- where you are 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the vi@@ c@@ tim is white than if the vi@@ c@@ tim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the vi@@ c@@ tim is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
well I believe that our identity is at risk .
that when we actually do not care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are n@@ one@@ the@@ less impli@@ cated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love enter@@ tainment .
but ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , abu@@ se , de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , mar@@ g@@ in@@ alization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integr@@ ate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hope@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ di@@ cated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to TED .
but thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we have not seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intel@@ le@@ ct as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
and it 's that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
V@@ ac@@ la@@ v Ha@@ vel , the great C@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
he said , " Wh@@ en we were in E@@ a@@ stern Europe and dealing with op@@ pression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit , a wil@@ li@@ ng@@ ness to sometimes be in hope@@ less places and be a wit@@ ness . "
well that ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be eng@@ aged in .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to inju@@ stice .
now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challeng@@ ing identity than ones that do not pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
I had the great pri@@ vi@@ lege , when I was a young law@@ yer , of meeting Ro@@ sa Par@@ ks .
and M@@ s. Par@@ ks used to come back to Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , John@@ ni@@ e Car@@ r who was the organi@@ z@@ er of the Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt -- amazing Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American woman -- and Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a D@@ ur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , C@@ lif@@ ford D@@ ur@@ r , represen@@ ted Dr. King .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then M@@ s. Car@@ r would call me , and she would say , " B@@ r@@ yan , M@@ s. Par@@ ks is coming to town . we are going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? "
and I would say , " Yes , M@@ a ' am , I do . "
and she would say , " Well what are you going to do when you get here ? "
I said , " I am going to listen . "
and I would go over there and I would , I would just listen .
it would be so ener@@ gi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
and one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours M@@ s. Par@@ ks turned to me and she said , " No@@ w B@@ r@@ yan , tell me what the E@@ qu@@ al Ju@@ stice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is .
tell me what you are trying to do . "
and I began giving her my ra@@ p .
I said , " Well we are trying to challenge inju@@ stice .
we are trying to help people who have been wro@@ ngly con@@ vi@@ cted .
we are trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation in the admini@@ stration of crimin@@ al justice .
we are trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le sen@@ ten@@ ces for children .
we are trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
we are trying to reduce the prison population .
we are trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . "
I gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , " M@@ mm m@@ mm m@@ mm . "
she said , " That 's going to make you tired , tired , tired . "
and that 's when M@@ s. Car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her fi@@ nger in my face , she said , " That 's why you have got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . "
and I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous .
we need to find ways to emb@@ race these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone 's humanity .
I have learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
it 's just taught me very simple things .
I have come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we have ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they are not just a liar .
I think if somebody takes something that does not be@@ long to them , they are not just a thi@@ ef .
I think even if you kill someone , you are not just a kil@@ ler .
and because of that there 's this basic human dig@@ nity that must be respe@@ cted by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this glo@@ be , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I do not believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dra@@ matic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so sti@@ mu@@ lating , we will ultimately not be ju@@ d@@ ged by our technology , we won ' t be ju@@ d@@ ged by our design , we won ' t be ju@@ d@@ ged by our intel@@ le@@ ct and reason .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
because it 's in that nex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I will end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get tired , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and I have been represen@@ ting these kids who have been sen@@ ten@@ ced to do these very har@@ sh sen@@ ten@@ ces .
and I go to the ja@@ il and I see my cli@@ ent who 's 13 and 14 , and he 's been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you are not ?
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but I see this kid .
and I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you are not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
yeah , B@@ r@@ yan , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because I was up too late , was not thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
and I had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : " motion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corpor@@ ate execu@@ tive . "
and I put in my motion that there was pro@@ secu@@ tori@@ al mis@@ condu@@ ct and police mis@@ condu@@ ct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ condu@@ ct .
there was a crazy line in there about how there 's no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it 's all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
and the next morning , I wo@@ ke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and I had just for@@ gotten all about it .
and I finally decided , oh go@@ sh , I have got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and I got into my car and I was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
and I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
and I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
and as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the j@@ an@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , " Wh@@ o are you ? "
I said , " I am a law@@ yer . " he said , " You are a law@@ yer ? " I said , " Yes , sir . "
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ gged me .
and he whi@@ sper@@ ed in my ear .
he said , " I am so proud of you . "
and I have to tell you , it was ener@@ gi@@ zing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hope@@ ful .
well I went into the cour@@ tr@@ oo@@ m .
and as soon as I walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
he said , " Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? "
I said , " Yes , sir . I did . " and we started argu@@ ing .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tr@@ aged .
I had written these crazy things .
and assi@@ stant pro@@ secu@@ tors and c@@ ler@@ k workers .
and before I knew it , the cour@@ tr@@ oo@@ m was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about in@@ equ@@ ality .
and out of the corner of my eye , I could see this j@@ an@@ it@@ or p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this hol@@ ler .
he kept p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
came into the cour@@ tr@@ oo@@ m and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the j@@ an@@ it@@ or had come into court .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty ju@@ mped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , " J@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tr@@ oo@@ m ? "
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , " I came into this cour@@ tr@@ oo@@ m to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the pri@@ ze , hold on . "
I have come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it b@@ ends toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ nity .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
that our vi@@ sions of technology and design and enter@@ tainment and creativity have to be married with vi@@ sions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , I have simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the pri@@ ze , hold on .
thank you very much .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of California , for example , there 's a refer@@ en@@ du@@ m coming up this spring where actually there 's going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
for example , here in California we are going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all h@@ omi@@ cide cases do not result in ar@@ rest .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe cases do not result .
so there 's an opportunity to change that .
and this refer@@ en@@ du@@ m would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ cement and safety .
and I think that opportunity exists all around us .
there 's been this huge dec@@ line in crime in America over the last three decades .
and part of the narra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it 's about increased in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country was not really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
that 's where the dra@@ matic incre@@ ases have come in our prison population .
and we got carried away with the r@@ he@@ tori@@ c of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
and I think our current p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
and I think that 's the ori@@ en@@ tation that we have to change .
B@@ r@@ yan , you have stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ ord here .
you are an in@@ spir@@ ing person .
thank you so much for coming to TED . thank you .
I am going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and this is about shif@@ ting ba@@ sel@@ ine .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my her@@ oes .
and he was here , as you well know , in ' 35 .
and you would think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he was not .
he was actually collec@@ ting fish .
and he described one of them as very " common . "
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
a big fi@@ sh@@ ery was run on it until the ' 8@@ 0s .
now the fish is on the I@@ U@@ C@@ N R@@ ed Li@@ st .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Gala@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to Gala@@ pa@@ gos .
we still think it is pri@@ sti@@ ne .
the bro@@ chu@@ res still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .
so what happens here ?
the second story , also to illu@@ str@@ ate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wai@@ st@@ line .
because I was there in ' 7@@ 1 , studying a La@@ go@@ on in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
and I thought I could bl@@ end in .
and I got a big sun@@ burn , and I was convin@@ ced that I was really not from there .
this was my first sun@@ burn .
and the La@@ go@@ on was surr@@ ounded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called bl@@ ack@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a .
and the fi@@ sh@@ eri@@ es for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in Gh@@ ana .
when I went there 27 years later , the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their size .
they were mat@@ ur@@ ing at five centi@@ meters .
they had been pu@@ shed gene@@ tically .
there were still fi@@ shes .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that I was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
in the ' 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the ' 6@@ 0s -- Europe did lots of development projects .
fish development meant im@@ po@@ sing on countries that had already 10@@ 0000 fi@@ sh@@ ers to im@@ pose on them industrial fi@@ shing .
and this boat , quite u@@ g@@ ly , is called the Mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4@@ .
and I went sa@@ iling on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the sou@@ thern South China sea and especially the Ja@@ va Se@@ a .
and what we caught , we did not have words for it .
what we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and 90 percent of our catch were spo@@ ng@@ es , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were cor@@ al ree@@ f fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transi@@ tion is very ra@@ pid .
within a year , you do a sur@@ vey and then commercial fi@@ shing begins .
the bottom is transfor@@ med from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft cor@@ al into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually collec@@ ted by fi@@ sh@@ ers every time they go into an area that 's never been fi@@ shed .
but it 's not docu@@ mented .
we transform the world , but we do not remember it .
we ad@@ just our ba@@ sel@@ ine to the new level , and we do not re@@ call what was there .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the gre@@ en@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or natur@@ ally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ po@@ late forward .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
but they do not percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
you can have a suc@@ ces@@ sion of changes .
at the end you want to susta@@ in mi@@ ser@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in pre@@ dat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they did not know they had done so after a few gener@@ ations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very a@@ bun@@ d@@ ant , before it gets ex@@ tin@@ ct , it becomes rare .
so you do not lose a@@ bun@@ d@@ ant animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore they are not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
over time , we concentr@@ ate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the ba@@ sel@@ ine .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they do not know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence presen@@ ted in an earlier mo@@ de is not in the way they would like the evidence presen@@ ted .
for example , the an@@ e@@ c@@ do@@ te that some present , as Cap@@ tain so@@ -@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fi@@ sh@@ ery scientists , because it 's not " scientific . "
so you have a situation where people do not know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they do not trust the sources of the past .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a mar@@ ine prote@@ cted area can play .
because with mar@@ ine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ cei@@ ve because the ba@@ sel@@ ine has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
that is for people who can see a mar@@ ine prote@@ cted area and who can benefit from the in@@ sight that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to re@@ set their ba@@ sel@@ ine .
how about the people who can ' t do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mi@@ d@@ west for example ?
there I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and si@@ mu@@ lation .
this is a si@@ mu@@ lation of Che@@ sa@@ pe@@ a@@ ke Bay .
there were gr@@ ay wh@@ ales in Che@@ sa@@ pe@@ a@@ ke Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like " A@@ v@@ at@@ ar . "
and if you think about " A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , " if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the Po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the imag@@ ery ?
because it evo@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my recommen@@ d@@ ation , it 's the only one I will provide , is for Cam@@ er@@ on to do " A@@ v@@ at@@ ar II " under@@ water .
thank you very much .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
I recently did a sur@@ vey with over 2000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
there was also recently a study done with CE@@ O@@ s in which they followed CE@@ O@@ s around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply docu@@ mented all the various ta@@ sks that these CE@@ O@@ s eng@@ aged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these ta@@ sks .
and they found that the average CEO eng@@ aged in about 13@@ 9 ta@@ sks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub@@ -@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own choices .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
how well do you think you are doing at man@@ aging those choices ?
today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choo@@ sing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as I talk about this problem , I am going to have some questions for you and I am going to want to know your answers .
so when I ask you a question , since I am blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , when I ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , I would like you to cla@@ p your hands .
so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
thank you .
so when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
it was a store called D@@ ra@@ e@@ ger 's .
now this store , it was almost like going to an a@@ mu@@ se@@ ment park .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ g@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bott@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
I used to love going to this store , but on one occa@@ sion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here 's their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thous@@ and@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
so I one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and I asked the man@@ ager , " Is this model of offer@@ ing people all this choice really working ? "
and he pointed to the bu@@ slo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with camer@@ as ready usually .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked j@@ am for our experiment .
here 's their j@@ am a@@ is@@ le .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of j@@ am .
we set up a little ta@@ sting boo@@ th right near the entr@@ ance of the store .
we there put out six different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am or 24 different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sa@@ mple some j@@ am ?
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
now we see the opposite effect .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they en@@ coun@@ tered six than if they en@@ coun@@ tered 24 .
now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- at least it 's good for our wai@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affe@@ cts us even in very consequ@@ ential decisions .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ intere@@ sts .
so now for the topic of today : financial sa@@ vings .
now I am going to describe to you a study I did with Gu@@ r Hu@@ ber@@ man , E@@ mi@@ r K@@ am@@ en@@ ic@@ a , We@@ i J@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ re@@ ment sa@@ vings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the U.S.
and what we looked at was whether the number of fun@@ d offer@@ ings available in a reti@@ re@@ ment sa@@ vings plan , the 4@@ 01 plan , does that affect people 's like@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
and what we found was that indeed there was a corre@@ lation .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that r@@ ang@@ ed from offer@@ ing people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fun@@ d offer@@ ings .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds offer@@ ed , indeed , there was less particip@@ ation rate .
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that offer@@ ed you two fun@@ ds , particip@@ ation rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
in those plans that offer@@ ed nearly 60 fun@@ ds , particip@@ ation rates have now dropped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to particip@@ ate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
so for those people who did choose to particip@@ ate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accoun@@ ts .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ comm@@ end for people when you are consider@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .
well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to offer@@ ing people more and more choices .
they are more likely to de@@ lay choo@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
they are more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
they are more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ ctively better .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ i@@ ses , mu@@ star@@ ds , v@@ ine@@ g@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can ' t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contr@@ as@@ ting and actually pic@@ king from that st@@ un@@ ning disp@@ lay .
so what I want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research venu@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
the first : cut .
you have heard it said before , but it 's never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always up@@ set when I say , " Cu@@ t . "
they are always worried they are going to lose shel@@ f space .
but in fact , what we are seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous re@@ d@@ un@@ d@@ ant op@@ tions , well there 's an increase in sales , there 's a low@@ ering of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .
when Pro@@ ctor & amp ; G@@ am@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of H@@ ead & amp ; shoul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the Gol@@ den C@@ at Cor@@ por@@ ation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and low@@ ering of costs .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5000 products .
the typical Wal@@ mar@@ t today off@@ ers you 10@@ 0000 products .
but the n@@ in@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the n@@ in@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sa@@ u@@ ce .
now in the financial sa@@ vings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offer@@ ings has actually been something that David L@@ ai@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in desig@@ ning , which was the program that they have at Harvard .
every single Harvard employe@@ e is now autom@@ a@@ tically en@@ rol@@ led in a life@@ cycle fun@@ d .
for those people who actually want to choose , they are given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
you know , often , people say , " I do not know how to cut .
they are all important choices . "
and the first thing I do is I ask the employees , " T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another .
and if your employees can ' t tell them apart , neither can your consum@@ ers . "
now before we started our se@@ ssion this afternoon , I had a ch@@ at with G@@ ary .
and G@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an al@@ l-@@ expen@@ se@@ s-@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here 's a descri@@ ption of the road .
and I would like you to read it .
and now I will give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to cla@@ p your hands if you are ready to take G@@ ary up on his offer .
okay . anybody who 's ready to take him up on his offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , did not you .
now who 's ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had obje@@ ctively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would ven@@ ture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an AT@@ M card or a credit card as op@@ posed to cash ?
because it does not feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ om@@ o Ben@@ ar@@ t@@ z@@ i and A@@ less@@ and@@ ro Pre@@ vit@@ er@@ o , we did a study with people at I@@ NG -- employees that are all working at I@@ NG -- and now these people were all in a se@@ ssion where they are doing en@@ rol@@ l@@ ment for their 4@@ 01 plan .
and during that se@@ ssion , we kept the se@@ ssion exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ rol@@ l@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sa@@ vings account by four percent .
the third techni@@ que : cate@@ gori@@ zation .
we can handle more categ@@ ories than we can handle choices .
so for example , here 's a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
it turns out that in We@@ g@@ m@@ ans gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 31 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
but you know what ?
if I show you 600 magaz@@ ines and I divide them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus I show you 400 magaz@@ ines and divide them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choo@@ sing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry disp@@ la@@ ys .
one is called " Ja@@ zz " and the other one is called " s@@ wing . "
if you think the disp@@ lay on the left is s@@ wing and the disp@@ lay on the right is Ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , there 's some .
if you think the one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you are right .
the one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly use@@ less cate@@ gori@@ zation sch@@ e@@ me .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
who are they actually supposed to be infor@@ ming ?
my fourth techni@@ que : condition for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we have just got to take it a little easier .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
I am going to show you one example of what I am talking about .
let 's take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here 's a German car manufactu@@ rer that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ st@@ om make your car .
you have got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
car colors , ex@@ teri@@ or car colors -- I have got 5@@ 6 choices .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
so now what I am going to do is I am going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
so half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
what am I going to look at ?
how eng@@ aged you are .
if you keep h@@ itting the de@@ fault bu@@ tton per decision , that means you are getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means I am losing you .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they are h@@ itting that de@@ fault bu@@ tton over and over and over again .
we are losing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they are h@@ anging in there .
it 's the same information . it 's the same number of choices .
the only thing that I have done is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is presen@@ ted .
if I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
even though choo@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift does not tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that I am putting together , so I am more willing to be moti@@ vated to be eng@@ aged .
so let me re@@ ca@@ p .
I have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ ga@@ ting the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alter@@ na@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; cate@@ gori@@ ze -- we can handle more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
all of these techniques that I am descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing .
and the more we are able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of choo@@ sing .
thank you very much .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and I think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that 's me .
and maybe I have been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ sti@@ ge to be able to do that .
before I actually begin the meat of my talk , let 's begin with a bit of ba@@ se@@ ball .
Hey , why not ?
we are near the end , we are getting close to the World S@@ eri@@ es .
we all love ba@@ se@@ ball , do not we ?
ba@@ se@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there 's hundreds of them .
" mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball " is about to come out , and it 's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great ba@@ se@@ ball team .
I am going to focus on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
it 's called bat@@ ting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who b@@ ats 300 .
that means that bal@@ l@@ player bat@@ ted safe@@ ly , hit safe@@ ly three times out of 10 at b@@ ats .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it did not get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base did not get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 h@@ it@@ ter in Ma@@ j@@ or Lea@@ gue Ba@@ se@@ ball ?
good , really good , maybe an al@@ l-@@ star .
do you know what they call a 400 ba@@ se@@ ball h@@ it@@ ter ?
that 's somebody who hit , by the way , four times safe@@ ly out of every 10 .
le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary -- as in T@@ ed Willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary -- the last Ma@@ j@@ or Lea@@ gue Ba@@ se@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regular seas@@ on .
now let 's take this back into my world of medicine where I am a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I am going to talk to you about .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ tis and you are refer@@ red to a sur@@ ge@@ on who 's bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ de@@ ct@@ omi@@ es .
somehow this is not working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ teri@@ es and your family doctor ref@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ dio@@ logist who 's bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
but , but , you know what ?
she 's doing a lot better this year . she 's on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
and she 's h@@ itting a 25@@ 7 .
somehow this is not working .
but I am going to ask you a question .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ dia@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on or a nurse practi@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ tho@@ pe@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on , an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N , a para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good sur@@ ge@@ on or physi@@ cian or para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to b@@ at .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that 's going to happen .
and that was the message that I ab@@ sor@@ bed when I was in med school .
I was an obse@@ ssive compu@@ l@@ sive student .
in high school , a cla@@ s@@ sm@@ ate once said that Bri@@ an Gol@@ d@@ man would study for a blood test .
and so I did .
and I studied in my little G@@ arre@@ t at the nur@@ ses ' resi@@ dence at Tor@@ onto Gener@@ al Ho@@ sp@@ ital , not far from here .
and I mem@@ ori@@ zed everything .
I mem@@ ori@@ zed in my an@@ at@@ omy class the orig@@ ins and ex@@ er@@ tions of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ ential diagno@@ ses ob@@ scu@@ re and common .
I even knew the differ@@ ential diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar aci@@ do@@ sis .
and all the while , I was ama@@ ssing more and more knowledge .
and I did well , I gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , cu@@ m lau@@ de .
and I came out of medical school with the impre@@ ssion that if I mem@@ ori@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immu@@ ni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until I met Mrs. D@@ ru@@ cker .
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Tor@@ onto when Mrs. D@@ ru@@ cker was brought to the emer@@ gency department of the hospital where I was working .
at the time I was as@@ signed to the car@@ dio@@ logy service on a car@@ dio@@ logy ro@@ tation .
and it was my job , when the emer@@ gency staff called for a car@@ dio@@ logy con@@ sul@@ t , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
and I saw Mrs. D@@ ru@@ cker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
and when I list@@ ened to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
and when I list@@ ened to her chest with a ste@@ tho@@ scope , I could hear cr@@ ack@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in cong@@ es@@ tive heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the lu@@ ngs fill up with blood , and that 's why you have short@@ ness of breath .
and that was not a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
I made it and I set to work tr@@ eating her .
I gave her as@@ p@@ ir@@ in . I gave her medi@@ cations to reli@@ eve the str@@ ain on her heart .
I gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and I felt really good .
and that 's when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home .
actually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
I did not pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ ni@@ sh addi@@ tional information about her .
maybe I did it for a good reason .
maybe I did not want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resident .
maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding 's patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that I made was worse .
in sending her home , I dis@@ regar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , " Gol@@ d@@ man , not a good idea . do not do this . "
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. D@@ ru@@ cker , " Do you think it 's okay if she goes home ? "
and the nurse thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly , " Yeah , I think she will do okay . "
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
so I signed the dis@@ charge pa@@ pers , and an am@@ bul@@ ance came , para@@ medi@@ cs came to take her home .
and I went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
but I carried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , I p@@ acked up to leave the hospital and walked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I do not usually do .
I walked through the emer@@ gency department on my way home .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. D@@ ru@@ cker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emer@@ gency physi@@ cians I know dre@@ ad .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there 's something particular about emer@@ gency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ e@@ ti@@ ngly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
" do you remember that patient you sent home ? "
the other nurse asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly .
" well she 's back , " in just that t@@ one of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after I would sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the para@@ medi@@ cs brought her back to the emer@@ gency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe sho@@ ck .
and she was b@@ arely breathing and she was blue .
and the emer@@ g@@ . staff pulled out all the stop@@ s .
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a v@@ enti@@ l@@ ator .
and I was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
and I went through this rol@@ ler co@@ a@@ ster , because after they sta@@ bili@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and I ho@@ ped against hope that she would reco@@ ver .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible brain damage .
and the family gather@@ ed .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they re@@ signed themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- Mrs. D@@ ru@@ cker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the u@@ nh@@ e@@ al@@ thy sha@@ me that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , i@@ sol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sha@@ me that you feel , because you can ' t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you be@@ tr@@ ay a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discu@@ ssions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , I will never make that mistake again .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
that 's the kind of sha@@ me that is a teacher .
the u@@ nh@@ e@@ al@@ thy sha@@ me I am talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it 's the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what I was feeling .
and it was not because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a do@@ ll .
he talked to the family , and I am quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that I did not get su@@ ed .
and I kept asking myself these questions .
why did not I ask my atten@@ ding ? why did I send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did I make such a stupid mistake ?
why did I go into medicine ?
slowly but su@@ rely , it lif@@ ted .
I began to feel a bit better .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cr@@ ack in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and I wonder@@ ed , maybe I could feel better again .
and I made myself a bar@@ gain that if only I re@@ double my effor@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and I went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later I was an atten@@ ding in the emer@@ gency department at a community hospital just north of Tor@@ onto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a s@@ ore thro@@ at .
it was busy , I was in a bit of a hurry .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
I looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
and I gave him a pre@@ scri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
and two days later I came to do my next emer@@ gency shift , and that 's when my chief asked to speak to me qui@@ e@@ tly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
" do you remember that patient you saw with the s@@ ore thro@@ at ? "
well it turns out , he did not have a str@@ ep thro@@ at .
he had a pot@@ entially life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condition called epi@@ glo@@ t@@ ti@@ tis .
you can Google it , but it 's an infection , not of the thro@@ at , but of the u@@ pper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
and fortunately he did not die .
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
and I went through the same period of sha@@ me and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt clean@@ sed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emer@@ gency shift , I missed app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ tis .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , I did not send them home and I do not think there was any gap in their care .
one I thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
I or@@ dered a kid@@ ney X-@@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleagu@@ e who was doing a reas@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ rant and called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
the other one had a lot of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
I or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colleagu@@ e to reas@@ se@@ ss him .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ rant , called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
and I would like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B@@ .@@ S.
some of my do@@ o@@ z@@ ies have been in the last five years .
alone , as@@ ha@@ med and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
here 's the problem : if I can ' t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can ' t find the sti@@ l@@ l-@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
how can I teach them about what I did so that they do not do the same thing ?
if I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
Oh yeah , you go to a co@@ ck@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you are not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if I were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I have just told you right now , I probably would not get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cr@@ ack a jo@@ ke , they would change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ tho@@ pe@@ di@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I would have trouble making eye contact with that person .
that 's the system that we have .
it 's a complete den@@ i@@ al of mistakes .
it 's a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mistakes and those who do not , those who can ' t handle sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
and it 's almost like an ide@@ o@@ logical reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journ@@ alism , I have made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything I can , from one of the first ar@@ ticles I wrote for the Tor@@ onto S@@ tar to my show " White co@@ at , B@@ lack Ar@@ t . "
and what I have learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medi@@ cation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , causing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
in this country , as many as 2@@ 4@@ 000 Can@@ a@@ di@@ ans die of preven@@ table medical er@@ r@@ ors .
in the United States , the Institute of Medi@@ cine pe@@ gged it at 10@@ 0000 .
in both cases , these are gro@@ ss under@@ estim@@ ates , because we really aren ' t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
and here 's the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doub@@ ling every two or three years , we can ' t keep up with it .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ va@@ sive .
we can ' t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ ru@@ l@@ ous and put a little bit of alcoho@@ l on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
I do not take the same history .
I am not a robot ; I do not do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren ' t cars ; they do not tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
given all of that , mistakes are in@@ ev@@ itable .
so if you take the system , as I was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profes@@ sion@@ als , well there won ' t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on " White co@@ at , B@@ lack Ar@@ t , " I made it a ha@@ bit of saying , " H@@ ere 's my worst mistake , " I would say to everybody from para@@ medi@@ cs to the chief of car@@ dia@@ c surgery , " H@@ ere 's my worst mistake , " bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , " What about yours ? " and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would reco@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , " L@@ ook , do not make the same mistake I did . "
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
and it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
the re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows she 's human , accep@@ ts it , is not proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she 's suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she points out other people 's mistakes , not in a Go@@ t@@ cha way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ dges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ u@@ ps that make it easier to dete@@ ct those mistakes that humans in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we are re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
my name is Bri@@ an Gol@@ d@@ man .
I am a re@@ defined physi@@ cian .
I am human . I make mistakes .
I am sorry about that , but I stri@@ ve to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still do not know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
Hi . I am K@@ ev@@ in Al@@ lo@@ c@@ ca , I am the tr@@ ends man@@ ager at YouTube , and I profes@@ sion@@ ally watch YouTube videos .
it 's true .
so we are going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir@@ al and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ e@@ di@@ ans -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture .
any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Satur@@ day .
but there are over 48 hours of video up@@ lo@@ aded to YouTube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vir@@ al and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , communities of particip@@ ation and unex@@ pe@@ c@@ te@@ dness .
all right , let 's go .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
W@@ oo@@ o !
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , B@@ ear V@@ as@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yo@@ se@@ m@@ ite National Park .
in 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
this is a char@@ t of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he did not actually set out to make a vir@@ al video , B@@ ear .
he just wanted to share a ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w .
because that 's what you do when your name is Yo@@ se@@ m@@ ite M@@ oun@@ tain B@@ ear .
and he had po@@ sted lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in Jan@@ u@@ ary .
so what happened here ?
J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l actually .
J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l po@@ sted this tw@@ e@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as popular as it would become .
because ta@@ ste@@ makers like J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it 's Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . go@@ tta get down on Fri@@ day . everybody 's looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ et@@ tin ' down on Fri@@ day . so you did not think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Re@@ be@@ c@@ ca B@@ lack 's " Fri@@ day " is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it 's been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a char@@ t of what it looked like .
and similar to " double Ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w , " it seems to have just sp@@ rou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a Fri@@ day , this is true .
and if you are wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also Fri@@ days .
but what about this day , this one particular Fri@@ day ?
well To@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blo@@ gs starting writing about .
Michael J@@ . N@@ el@@ son from my@@ stery Sci@@ ence The@@ ater was one of the first people to post a jo@@ ke about the video on Twitter .
but what 's important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10000 par@@ o@@ dies of " Fri@@ day " on YouTube .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
un@@ like the one-@@ way enter@@ tainment of the 20@@ th century , this community particip@@ ation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by sp@@ reading it or by doing something new with it .
so " N@@ yan C@@ at " is a lo@@ op@@ ed ani@@ mation with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
it 's this , just like this .
it 's been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that 's been vie@@ wed four million times .
even c@@ ats were watching this video .
c@@ ats were watching other c@@ ats watch this video .
but what 's important here is the creativity that it inspired a@@ mo@@ ng@@ st this te@@ chi@@ e , ge@@ e@@ ky Internet culture .
there were re@@ mi@@ xes .
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
and then it went international .
an entire re@@ mix community sp@@ rou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we do not just enjoy now , we particip@@ ate .
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
who could have predi@@ cted " double Ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w " or Re@@ be@@ c@@ ca B@@ lack or " N@@ yan C@@ at ? "
what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written that would have conta@@ ined this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get up@@ lo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unex@@ pe@@ cted can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy pro@@ testing bi@@ cycle fin@@ es in New York City , I ad@@ mit I was not very interested .
so I got a tic@@ ket for not ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e .
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , Ca@@ se@@ y Ni@@ e@@ st@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do creati@@ vely .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
what does this mean ?
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
what does it mean ?
Ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ting communities , complete unex@@ pe@@ c@@ te@@ dness , these are characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popu@@ lar@@ ity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , Ju@@ sti@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber , got his start on YouTube .
no one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea .
and we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
and these are not characteri@@ stics of old media , and they are b@@ arely true of the media of today , but they will define the enter@@ tainment of the future .
thank you .
today I am going to talk about unex@@ pe@@ cted dis@@ cover@@ ies .
now I work in the solar technology industry .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
it 's just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we will just -- we can just ski@@ p -- I will just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
Oh , that 's all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
my story begins right here actually in Ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
I was in the deser@@ t , under the star@@ ry ski@@ es with the Su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er Mu@@ kh@@ ti@@ ar Al@@ i .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epi@@ c " The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata . "
so back in the day , when us In@@ di@@ ans wanted to travel we would jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we would z@@ oo@@ m across the sky .
now we do the same with air@@ plan@@ es .
back then , when Ar@@ j@@ un@@ a , the great Indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he would take out a bo@@ w , he would shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
now we do the same with dri@@ l@@ ls and machines .
the conclu@@ sion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by mach@@ in@@ ery .
and this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a techno@@ pho@@ be .
I was terri@@ fied by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without tw@@ e@@ e@@ ting it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
when I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
and this piece of 5@@ 0@@ -year-old technology became the most ma@@ gi@@ cal thing to me .
it became a gi@@ l@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of p@@ ir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
so I felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our camer@@ as had stopped us from dre@@ am@@ ing .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so I ju@@ mped in , I ju@@ mped into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
I have been illu@@ str@@ ating books since I was 16 .
and so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a stor@@ y@@ telling device that could connect read@@ ers all over the world .
it can know how we are holding it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together image and text and ani@@ mation and sound and touch .
stor@@ y@@ telling is becoming more and more multi@@ -@@ sens@@ ori@@ al .
but what are we doing with it ?
so I am actually just going to go in and la@@ unch K@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active app for the iPad .
so it says , " P@@ l@@ ace your fingers upon each light . "
and so -- It says , " This box be@@ lo@@ ngs to ... " And so I type in my name .
and actually I become a character in the book .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually ad@@ dre@@ ssed to me .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possi@@ bilities .
now I have been talking a lot about magic .
and I do not mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bo@@ red as children .
this idea of fi@@ ref@@ lies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your iPad , take the fi@@ ref@@ lies out .
and they actually illu@@ minate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire gala@@ xy could be conta@@ ined within a single mar@@ ble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gi@@ cal device within the device .
and it op@@ ens up a map .
all along , all fanta@@ sy books have always had ma@@ ps , but these ma@@ ps have been sta@@ tic .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your na@@ vi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so I am just going to enter in .
another thing that 's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very con@@ tempor@@ ary .
over here , these are the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as .
so we have all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we have all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts , the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as ?
these poor A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside Ind@@ ra 's ch@@ am@@ b@@ ers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
and so we are bringing them back in a con@@ tempor@@ ary story for children .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , glu@@ ed to their P@@ C@@ s , they have not been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you are sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
when I was a child , I had multiple collec@@ tions of sti@@ cks and st@@ ones and pe@@ bb@@ les and shel@@ ls .
and somehow kids do not do that anymore .
so in bringing back this childhood rit@@ u@@ al , you need to go out and , in one ch@@ ap@@ ter , take a picture of a flower and then ta@@ g it .
in another ch@@ ap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then ta@@ g that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photograph@@ s that you can then put up online .
a child in London puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , " Oh , I saw a fo@@ x today . "
a child in India says , " I saw a mon@@ key today . "
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photograph@@ s that you have actually taken .
in the possi@@ bilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possi@@ bilities .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through au@@ g@@ mented reality , you see this layer of ani@@ m@@ ated pi@@ xi@@ es appear on a house@@ plant that 's outside your house .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
we are moving , we are all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
we are har@@ ne@@ ssing energy from the sun .
we are bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medi@@ um of a story .
thank you .
because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing ju@@ mps in technology that seem so fast that we can b@@ arely keep on top of it .
so I am going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that 's on .
this is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
what I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of R@@ I@@ S@@ C micro@@ pro@@ cess@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we are used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of ma@@ gn@@ itu@@ de in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that 's basically what I am going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because I am just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let 's say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I am trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
they sort of go like this .
and they do not tell us much .
now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transp@@ or@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ ati@@ vely changing .
so if transp@@ or@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ pro@@ cess@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a ta@@ xi ca@@ b and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
it 's not moving like that .
and there 's nothing pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fee@@ ding growth where you go by orders of ma@@ gn@@ itu@@ de every few years .
now the question that I would like to ask is , if you look at these exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ves , they do not go on forever .
things just can ' t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it 's going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal S@@ -@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it 's going to do this .
that 's about all it can do .
now I am an optimi@@ st , so I sort of think it 's probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we are in the middle of right now is a transi@@ tion .
we are sort of on this line in a transi@@ tion from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what I am trying to ask , what I have been asking myself , is what 's this new way that the world is ?
what 's that new state that the world is hea@@ ding toward ?
because the transi@@ tion seems very , very confu@@ sing when we are right in the middle of it .
now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here 's a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it 's about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been sh@@ rin@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something 's happening there .
that transi@@ tion is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just does not make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything 's going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we are doing just does not make any sense at all .
so what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transi@@ tion could be that we are going through .
now in order to do that I am going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
so I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , steri@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemi@@ cals flo@@ ating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the chemi@@ cals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and I think that there 's the@@ ories that are beginning to understand about how it started with R@@ NA , but I am going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemi@@ cals in them .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular comb@@ ination of chemi@@ cals in them which caused them to in@@ corpor@@ ate chemi@@ cals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
and those that were like that started to sp@@ lit and divide .
and those were the most pri@@ mi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren ' t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemi@@ cals .
and every time it divided , they got sort of une@@ qu@@ al divi@@ sion of the chemi@@ cals within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating chemi@@ cals around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more chemi@@ cals and divided more .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get ex@@ pressed more .
now that 's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about ab@@ str@@ action .
somehow by ways that we do not quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evo@@ lu@@ tionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed stea@@ dy since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that I did just for a@@ mu@@ se@@ ment pur@@ po@@ ses is we can now write things in this code .
and I have got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which I try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
but this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and a@@ mp@@ li@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , I have pl@@ enty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it 's right here .
if I had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communi@@ cating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I do not know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .
now that 's why , for instance , anti@@ bio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , because bacteria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were fa@@ vo@@ red by evolution .
now the transi@@ tion point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one str@@ ing of DNA .
and so the next stage that 's interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi@@ -@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organi@@ sm .
and in fact , we are such a multi@@ -@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really use@@ less without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organi@@ sm .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to ab@@ str@@ act information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neur@@ al structures .
so neurons are the information proces@@ sing appar@@ atus that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evo@@ lu@@ tionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organi@@ sm , instead of over this evo@@ lu@@ tionary time sp@@ an .
so an organi@@ sm could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organi@@ sm , whereas before they would built these special information proces@@ sing structures , that would have had to be learned evo@@ lu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremend@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolution .
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tri@@ cks of communi@@ cating .
and for example , the most so@@ phi@@ sti@@ cated version that we are aware of is human language .
it 's really a pretty amazing inven@@ tion if you think about it .
here I have a very complicated , m@@ ess@@ y , confu@@ sed idea in my head .
I am sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully con@@ struc@@ ting a similar m@@ ess@@ y , confu@@ sed idea in your head that be@@ ars some an@@ alo@@ gy to it .
but we are taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequ@@ ences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start fun@@ ction@@ ing as a single organi@@ sm .
and so , in fact , what we have done is we , humanity , have started ab@@ str@@ acting out .
we are going through the same levels that multi@@ -@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar organisms have gone through -- ab@@ str@@ acting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , presen@@ ting , proces@@ sing information .
so for example , the inven@@ tion of language was a tiny step in that direction .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ o@@ ta@@ pes , C@@ D@@ -@@ R@@ O@@ M@@ s and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechani@@ sms that we have now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
and you saw T@@ y 's little evo@@ lu@@ tionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ vo@@ lution program right before your eyes .
so now we have spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
so the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is fee@@ ding on itself and becoming , I guess , au@@ to@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something re@@ infor@@ ces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and I think that that 's what we are seeing here in this explo@@ sion of cur@@ ve .
we are seeing this process fee@@ ding back on itself .
now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechani@@ sms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I do not know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
there are billions of them .
instead , what I do and what the desig@@ ners at Th@@ in@@ king machines do is we think at some level of ab@@ str@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we do not quite even understand .
one method that 's particularly interesting that I have been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
say , " Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please make a hundred million random sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now would you please run all of those random sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ se@@ st to doing what I wanted . "
so in other words , I define what I wanted .
let 's say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I have done it with .
so find the programs that come clo@@ se@@ st to sor@@ ting numbers .
so of course , random sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and I say , " Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequ@@ ences that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let 's re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
and let 's re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ comb@@ ination an@@ alo@@ g@@ ous to sex . "
take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children inh@@ er@@ it the tra@@ its of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
so I have got now a new generation of programs that are produced by comb@@ in@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
say , " P@@ lease repe@@ at that process . "
sc@@ ore them again .
introduce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those gener@@ ations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
so I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
now if I look at those programs , I can ' t tell you how they work .
I have tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they are ob@@ scu@@ re , weird programs .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I am very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
I was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with Mar@@ v@@ in Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , " Oh look . look at this .
it says , ' This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . ' does not that make you feel confi@@ dent ? "
in fact , we know that the engineering process does not work very well when it gets complicated .
so we are beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that 's very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we do not quite understand the op@@ tions of it .
so in a sense , it 's getting ahead of us .
we are now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we will be able to run this process much faster .
so it 's fee@@ ding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that 's why I think it seems so confu@@ sing .
because all of these technologies are fee@@ ding back on themselves .
we are taking off .
and what we are is we are at a point in time which is an@@ alo@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms were turning into multi@@ -@@ cel@@ led organisms .
so we are the a@@ mo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can ' t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we are creating .
we are right at that point of transi@@ tion .
but I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it 's very ha@@ u@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we are the end product of evolution .
and I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get se@@ lec@@ ted out .
so a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the ro@@ ck@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they are supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called Co@@ de for America , and it 's a little bit like a Pe@@ ace Cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lows every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the Thi@@ r@@ d World , we send them into the wil@@ ds of City Hall .
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
but really what they are doing is they are showing what 's possible with technology today .
so meet Al .
Al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of Boston .
here it kind of looks like he 's looking for a date , but what he 's really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he 's not very good at fighting fi@@ res when he 's covered in four feet of s@@ now .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
we had a team of fel@@ lows in Boston last year through the Co@@ de for America program .
they were there in Fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in Fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to di@@ gging out these fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named E@@ ri@@ k Micha@@ el@@ s-@@ O@@ ber , noticed something else , and that 's that citizens are sho@@ v@@ eling out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good develo@@ per would do , he wrote an app .
it 's a cu@@ te little app where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
so you agree to di@@ g it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
and if you do not , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
so it 's got cu@@ te little game dyna@@ mics on it .
this is a mode@@ st little app .
it 's probably the sm@@ alle@@ st of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lows wrote last year .
but it 's doing something that no other government technology does .
it 's sp@@ reading vir@@ ally .
there 's a guy in the I@@ .@@ T@@ . department of the City of H@@ on@@ o@@ lu@@ l@@ u who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t t@@ sun@@ ami si@@ re@@ ns .
it 's very important that these t@@ sun@@ ami si@@ re@@ ns work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ teri@@ es out of them .
so he 's getting citizens to check on them .
and then Se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ gged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
and Chicago just rol@@ led it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just fri@@ ction@@ less@@ ly , org@@ an@@ ically , natur@@ ally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this is not how it normally goes .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ ne@@ ls , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that 's nothing .
there is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it does not work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then sp@@ rea@@ ds vir@@ ally , that 's sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institu@@ tion of government .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
and that means per@@ mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
and that 's important .
but what 's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is t@@ ack@@ ling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institu@@ tion , but as a problem of collective action .
and that 's great news , because , it turns out , we are very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there 's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effe@@ ctively .
it 's not just Co@@ de for America fel@@ lows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
they have not given up on government .
they are fru@@ str@@ ated as hell with it , but they are not compla@@ ining about it , they are fi@@ x@@ ing it .
and these fol@@ ks know something that we have lost sight of .
and that 's that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the D@@ M@@ V and all those other things that we are really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of T@@ im O ' Re@@ il@@ ly , " What we do together that we can ' t do alone . "
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you are one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately deri@@ ves its power from us -- remember " We the people ? " -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now I did not know very much about government when I started this program .
and like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to office .
well after two years , I have come to the conclu@@ sion that , especially local government , is about op@@ o@@ s@@ su@@ ms .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it 's generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city 's call center , as our fellow Sco@@ tt S@@ il@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op@@ o@@ s@@ sum stuck in your house .
so Sco@@ tt gets this call .
he types " O@@ po@@ s@@ sum " into this official knowledge base .
he does not really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , " L@@ ook , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? "
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for Sco@@ tt .
but that was not the end of the op@@ o@@ s@@ su@@ ms .
Boston does not just have a call center .
it has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ ne@@ ct .
now we did not write this app .
this is the work of the very smart people at the Offi@@ ce of New U@@ r@@ ban me@@ chan@@ ics in Boston .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : " O@@ po@@ s@@ sum in my tra@@ sh@@ can . can ' t tell if it 's dead .
how do I get this re@@ moved ? "
but what happens with Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ ne@@ ct is different .
so Sco@@ tt was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
but on Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ ne@@ ct everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
and the next report we got said , " I walked over to this location , found the tra@@ sh@@ can behind the house .
O@@ po@@ s@@ sum ? check . living ? Y@@ ep .
turned tra@@ sh@@ can on its side . walked home .
Goo@@ d@@ night sweet op@@ o@@ s@@ sum . "
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it 's also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
but it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
and I do not mean necessarily a techno@@ logical definition of platform here .
I am just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citiz@@ en helped another citiz@@ en , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they would been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and chea@@ per alternative to government services .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it 's not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the in@@ put to the other .
that our in@@ put to the system of government is vo@@ ting .
now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elec@@ ted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that 's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x-@@ inch layer on top .
and what 's under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ acy .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it 's that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that 's working against us , this other thing , and then we are dise@@ m@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
people seem to think politics is se@@ xy .
if we want this institu@@ tion to work for us , we are going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ acy se@@ xy .
because that 's where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the mach@@ in@@ ery of government .
so that 's O@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ y@@ the@@ S@@ E@@ C movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it 's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that 's a response to the S@@ E@@ C 's re@@ quest for com@@ ment on the Fin@@ an@@ cial re@@ form Bill .
that 's not being poli@@ tically active , that 's being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
now for those of us who have given up on government , it 's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they are going to face .
do we really think we are going to get where we need to go without fi@@ x@@ ing the one institu@@ tion that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
we can ' t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamen@@ tally re@@ fra@@ me the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
and there 's a generation out there that 's grown up on the Internet , and they know that it 's not that hard to do things together , you just have to archite@@ ct the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fel@@ lows is 28 , so I am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ gi@@ ngly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that 's grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
they are not fighting that battle that we are all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do .
so when they are fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they do not care as much about using their voices .
they are using their hands .
they are using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be sho@@ v@@ eling out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ b@@ age can with an op@@ o@@ s@@ sum in it .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ v@@ eling out those fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts all along , and many people do .
but these app@@ s are like little digital re@@ min@@ ders that we are not just consum@@ ers , and we are not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we are not going to fix government until we fix citiz@@ en@@ ship .
so the question I have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
and I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at R@@ ad@@ b@@ oud University is we ap@@ pointed a chief listening officer .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , " What 's up ?
how could we help you ? "
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my Wi@@ F@@ i scale . it 's a very simple thing .
it 's got one kno@@ b , on / off .
and every morning I ho@@ p on it .
and yes , I have got a challenge , as you might see .
and I put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
but the thing is that it 's made this simple that whenever I ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through Google Health as well .
and it 's collec@@ ted by my general practi@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what 's my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need car@@ dio@@ logic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
but there 's another thing .
as some of you might know , I have got more than 4@@ 000 fol@@ lowers on Twitter .
so every morning I ho@@ p on my Wi@@ F@@ i scale and before I am in my car , people start talking to me , " I think you need a light lunch today , Lu@@ ci@@ en . "
but that 's the ni@@ ce@@ st thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obe@@ sity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explo@@ sion , doub@@ led demand and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to emb@@ race patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we have all got na@@ vi@@ gation contr@@ ols in our car .
we maybe even [ have ] it in our cell@@ phone .
we know perfectly where all the AT@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would be the near@@ est A@@ E@@ D to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the near@@ est life@@ -@@ saving A@@ E@@ D was to be ob@@ ta@@ ined right now .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced The Ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , " If you see an A@@ E@@ D , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it 's open , " since sometimes in office hours sometimes it 's closed , of course .
and over 10000 A@@ E@@ D@@ s already in The Ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and we built an iPad appli@@ cation .
we made an appli@@ cation for La@@ y@@ ar , au@@ g@@ mented reality , to find these A@@ E@@ D@@ s .
and whenever you are in a city like Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the near@@ est A@@ E@@ D which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ E@@ U , which is what the product is called , but also A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ US .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and [ we are ] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleagu@@ e univer@@ si@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these A@@ E@@ D@@ s all around the world .
that whenever you are on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own rela@@ tive or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these A@@ E@@ D@@ s .
these might be cou@@ ri@@ er services or ca@@ ble guys for instance , just to see whether the A@@ E@@ D that 's sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
I am here to share my photograph@@ y .
or is it photograph@@ y ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can ' t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mi@@ xed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ gger .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
so I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ gger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unex@@ pe@@ cted tw@@ ist .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of reali@@ sm .
or photos like these -- both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of reali@@ sm .
when I say reali@@ sm , I mean photo@@ -@@ reali@@ sm .
because , of course , it 's not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it 's more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
but what 's the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illu@@ sion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illu@@ sion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
it 's not really what is reali@@ stic , it 's what we think looks reali@@ stic really .
so I think the basi@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can re@@ late to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but comb@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can ' t .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply does not accept the fact that it does not really make sense .
and I see the same process with comb@@ ining photograph@@ s .
it 's just really about comb@@ ining different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make a photograph look reali@@ stic , I think it 's the things that we do not even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when comb@@ ining photograph@@ s , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result .
as you can see , these images aren ' t really special .
but comb@@ ined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos comb@@ ined should have the same perspective .
secon@@ dly , photos comb@@ ined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to di@@ sti@@ ngu@@ i@@ sh where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
so by mat@@ ching color , con@@ tra@@ st and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , adding photo@@ graphic defe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , de@@ s@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
so here 's another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what 's mani@@ pu@@ lated .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photograph@@ s from different lo@@ cations .
I personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you do not need to comp@@ r@@ omi@@ se with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fi@@ shing trip .
the sho@@ res are from a different location .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
and yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dish .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , I think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a ske@@ tch , an idea .
then it 's about comb@@ ining the different photograph@@ s .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
and if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagination .
thank you .
this may sound strange , but I am a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks were manufactu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : modu@@ les made of cement of a fixed measu@@ re@@ ment that fit together .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ dges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blo@@ cks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 19@@ 4@@ 7 , LE@@ G@@ O came up with this .
it was called the Au@@ tom@@ atic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck .
and in a few short years , LE@@ G@@ O bri@@ cks took place in every house@@ hold .
it 's estim@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
you do not have to be an engine@@ er to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ dges , beautiful buildings .
Le@@ go made it ac@@ ces@@ sible .
Le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
mean@@ while the exact same year , at B@@ ell L@@ ab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks p@@ iled on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
but there 's a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
I personally do not accept this , that the building block of our time is re@@ served for experts , so I decided to change that .
eight years ago when I was at the Me@@ dia La@@ b , I started expl@@ oring this idea of how to put the power of engine@@ ers in the hands of artists and desig@@ ners .
a few years ago I started developing li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its .
let me show you how they work .
L@@ it@@ tle@@ B@@ its are electr@@ onic modu@@ les with each one specific function .
they are pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mo@@ tors and sens@@ ors .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
so you can ' t put them the wrong way .
the bri@@ cks are col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is in@@ put and or@@ ange is wi@@ re .
so all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you have made a little di@@ m@@ mer .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se modu@@ le , which is here , and now you have made a little blin@@ ker .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra p@@ unch and you have created a noise machine .
I am going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wi@@ re , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive ge@@ stu@@ res .
so to make this b@@ link faster or s@@ lower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ lower .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its is that it 's a growing libr@@ ary .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mo@@ tors -- everything should be ac@@ ces@@ sible .
we have been giving li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it 's been an incredible experience .
the ni@@ ce@@ st thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they do not learn at schools .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an ele@@ v@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an iP@@ od respon@@ ds to touch .
we have also been taking li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its to design schools .
so for example , we have had desig@@ ners with no experience with electr@@ on@@ ics wha@@ t@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bott@@ les , we have Geor@@ die making ...
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its to R@@ I@@ S@@ D and gave them to some desig@@ ners with no experience in engineering wha@@ t@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them " Ma@@ ke something . "
here 's an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ acti@@ vated con@@ fe@@ tt@@ i can@@ on ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it 's a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that 's afraid of the dark .
to these non-@@ engine@@ ers , li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
and we want to make this material ac@@ ces@@ sible to everyone .
so li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its is open-@@ source .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
we want to encourage a world of cre@@ ators , of inven@@ tors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
so go ahead and start inven@@ ting .
thank you .
in the 198@@ 0s in the communi@@ st E@@ a@@ stern Germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
you had to regi@@ ster a sa@@ mple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the West could not understand how anybody could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color la@@ ser prin@@ ter from any major la@@ ser prin@@ ter manufactu@@ rer and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow do@@ ts prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fu@@ ss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what 's really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
we have three main groups .
we have online crimin@@ als .
like here , we have Mr. Di@@ mi@@ try Go@@ lu@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res online , mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their attacks .
here 's V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ oni@@ a .
this is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
this is Ste@@ phen Wat@@ t .
this is B@@ j@@ or@@ n Sun@@ d@@ in .
this is Mat@@ the@@ w An@@ derson , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the il@@ legal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sho@@ pping from an infected computer .
the U.S. Se@@ cre@@ t Ser@@ vice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ wi@@ ss bank account of Mr. S@@ am Ja@@ in right here , and that bank account had 14 point 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
Mr. Ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
and I claim it 's already today that it 's more likely for any of us to become the vi@@ c@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it 's very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not moti@@ vated by money .
they are moti@@ vated by something else -- moti@@ vated by prote@@ sts , moti@@ vated by an opinion , moti@@ vated by the laugh@@ s .
groups like An@@ on@@ y@@ mous have ri@@ sen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
so those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ y@@ mous doing it for the prote@@ st , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar is a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
it was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into .
somebody broke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
and I asked last week in a meeting with Du@@ tch government represen@@ ta@@ tives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pla@@ u@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar ha@@ ck .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
well Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar is a C@@ .@@ A.
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate if you have a website that has , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in to@@ tal@@ it@@ arian states like Iran , where di@@ ssi@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can ' t S@@ no@@ o@@ p on their discu@@ ssions .
except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign C@@ .@@ A.
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar .
what about Arab S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egy@@ pt ?
well in Egy@@ pt , the ri@@ o@@ ters loo@@ ted the head@@ quar@@ ters of the Egy@@ pti@@ an secret police in A@@ pri@@ l 2011 , and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of pa@@ pers .
among those pa@@ pers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led " F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . "
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egy@@ pti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0000 Euro@@ s to the Egy@@ pti@@ an government .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
so Western governments are provi@@ ding to@@ tal@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called State Tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a Tro@@ j@@ an used by German government officials to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
if you are a suspe@@ ct in a crimin@@ al case , well it 's pretty obvious , your phone will be ta@@ pped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will ta@@ p your Internet connection .
they will even use tools like State Tro@@ j@@ an to in@@ fect your computer with a Tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discu@@ ssions , to collect your pas@@ s@@ words .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , " Okay , that sounds bad , but that does not really affect me because I am a legal citiz@@ en .
why should I worry ?
because I have nothing to hi@@ de . "
and this is an argument , which does not make sense .
pri@@ v@@ acy is imp@@ lied .
pri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discu@@ ssion .
this is not a question between pri@@ v@@ acy against security .
it 's a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .

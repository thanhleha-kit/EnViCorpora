Coronavirus in Germany: Angela Merkel urges people to stay home 'whenever possible'
Angela Merkel has called for solidarity as Germany enters a "very serious phase" of the pandemic. Germany has again set a new daily case record, as ministers call for thousands of additional contact tracers.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday urged residents to stay at home amid a dramatic increase in the number of coronavirus infections in Germany.
"We have to do everything we can now to ensure that the virus does not spread uncontrollably — every day counts," Merkel said in her weekly podcast.
"I ask you to refrain from any trip that is not really necessary, any celebration that is not really necessary. Please stay at home - wherever you are, whenever possible," she said.
Merkel said that Germany was currently in the midst of a "very serious phase" of the pandemic, adding that "the number of new infections is increasing by leaps and bounds every day."
"The comparatively relaxed summer is over; now we are facing difficult months. How winter will be, how our Christmas will be, will be decided in the coming days and weeks. We all decide that through our actions."
She called on Germans to show solidarity and restraint, as they did in the early phase of the pandemic.
"What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic?" she asked. "It was that we stood together and obeyed the rules out of consideration and common sense. This is the most effective remedy we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever."
On Saturday, the Robert Koch Institute for disease control said Germany recorded 7,830 new coronavirus infections in the past 24-hour period, a new record since the pandemic began.
The number of cases was nearly 500 higher than on Friday and more than 1,500 higher than the prior infection peak recorded in March.
Officials say testing capacity has been greatly expanded since the beginning of the pandemic and that is one of the reasons why the country is seeing a spike in infections.
A second wave also appears to be in full swing due to a Europe-wide loosening of restrictions over the summer.
Braun also noted that the country's coronavirus tracing app was seeing a "steep rise" in alerts to the public.
By Tuesday, the app had sent warnings to the anonymous contacts of some 10,860 users who had subsequently tested positive for the virus.
The app has been downloaded around 19.6 million times and experts believe it is being used by around 16 million people.
Braun also told the regional paper that he is in favor of holding a state ceremony to remember those who have died from COVID-19.
He acknowledged that relatives of the dead may have not welcomed comments made by ministers over the summer that Germany had come through the health crisis relatively unscathed.
"To them, I say that the victims of this pandemic will not be forgotten under any circumstances.”
COVID-19: What role does blood type play?
A case of COVID-19 can be from mild to severe. Sometimes no symptoms are present. Sometimes people die. More and more studies suggest that blood types may play an important role by affecting immune responses.
Why do some people not notice at all that they have contracted the coronavirus, while others require medical treatment — and, in the worst cases, even die?
That COVID-19 seems so unpredictable also makes it difficult to find out how many people are actually infected and how many have already built up immunity. The number of unreported cases is correspondingly high.
Already in June, German and Norwegian researchers analyzed different blood types with regards to COVID-19. They came up with some informative results, which they published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers investigated the role blood type might play in patients with particularly severe forms of the disease.
In the study, the researchers examined 1,610 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure in Italy and Spain, where the coronavirus hit particularly hard: Milan, Monza, Madrid, San Sebastian, and Barcelona. All patients were struggling with particularly severe cases, and some did not survive.
Blood type A means highest risk
A first result: People with blood type A seem to be at a particularly high risk of a severe case of COVID-19. In Germany, 43% of the population has this blood type. In the event of coronavirus infection, these individuals might be two times more likely to need an oxygen supply or respirator than people with blood type O: 41% of Germany's population. 
Blood type O may be able to consider themselves lucky as things stand. Even though they are not protected against an infection, the study shows they have the lowest risk of coming down with a severe case of the disease.
People with blood type O- (O negative) also play a special role as blood donors, as they are considered "universal donors" and can help anyone in need of a blood transfusion. 
Blood types B and AB are not as widespread, making up just 11% and 5% of the population, respectively. According to the study, the likelihood of a severe COVID-19 diagnosis for these groups could lie somewhere between that of people with blood types O or A.
Since then, further studies have been added to confirm the original results. On 14 October, two studies appeared in the journal Blood Advances, which also show less severe symptoms of the disease in people in blood group O. Simultaneously, the Medical University of Graz independently reported a series of experiments, designed to further investigate the phenomenon.  
Consequences for treatment
The results of the studies may help in developing various drug treatments. Researchers have used similar approaches when searching for medication to fight other diseases.
In the case of malaria, for example, scientists have established a link between the disease and different blood types. For example, it is now known that people with blood type O very rarely develop severe malaria and are very well-protected against its most severe form.
In the case of other diseases, other blood types protect the human body best. For example, with the bubonic plague, people with blood type A showed the mildest symptoms.
For a long time, COVID-19 research focused on high-risk patients: Those who have certain preexisting conditions and/or have reached a certain age. Smokers also came under scrutiny as a potentially high-risk group. Now, researchers are looking at a different piece in the coronavirus jigsaw puzzle. 
Coronavirus: France's Macron announces curfew for Paris and Marseille
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a late night curfew for residents in Paris, Marseille and seven other cities. The government also moved to reinstate its COVID-19 state of health emergency.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday that locals in Paris and eight other cities will have to stick to a curfew from 9:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.
The restriction, which will come into force on Saturday and last for at least four weeks, will mean residents will not be able to go to restaurants or private homes during these hours.
Macron said on national television: "We have to act. We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus."
In addition to Paris and the region surrounding it, the new measures also targeted the cities of Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Rouen, Saint-Etienne and Toulouse.
"We won't be leaving the restaurant after 9:00 p.m.," Macron said. "We won't be partying with friends because we know that that's where the contamination risk is greatest."
Anyone found to be transgressing the new rules will face a fine of €135 ($159).
"We are in a worrying situation," he continued, while insisting France had not "lost control" of the virus.
The new measures are intended to curb the spread of the virus in France and get a grip on a recent surge in new cases.
On Wednesday, health authorities announced more than 9,100 patients were currently in hospital being treated for COVID-19, the highest figure since June 25, leading some experts to suggest the country's medical system is on the verge of being overwhelmed.
State of emergency
Shortly before the curfew was announced, the French government moved to reinstate a public health state of emergency in a bid to curb an uptick in coronavirus infections across the country.
The formal declaration was made in a statement by the government, adding that the pandemic was a public health disaster which endangered the well-being of the entire population.
France was facing "a health catastrophe," according to minutes from a Cabinet meeting that took place on Wednesday.
The state of health emergency is a legal framework allowing the government to take a stricter line on fighting the spread of infections.
Earlier this year France declared a state of health emergency which expired on July 10. 
Coronavirus drugs: Can antibodies from survivors help?
Aside from a Covid-19 vaccine, antibodies from recovered patients could provide a short-term "passive immunization" to the disease. A German immunologist saved thousands of lives with the method 100 years ago.
About 80,000 people worldwide have survived a Covid-19 infection. Their immune systems will have produced antibodies, which will help their bodies recognize and fight a repeat attack by the coronavirus. It's a natural defense mechanism.
But while we wait for a vaccine to prevent infection, those antibodies could be used to help those infected.
Those antibodies can be extracted from the blood serum of surviving patients, and then injected into infected people. Those people should then develop a "passive immunity."
Advantages and disadvantages of serum therapy
A passive immunization functions like a treament for infected patients, but it doesn't provide long-term protection. It's called passive immunization, because the recipient body hasn't actively produced any antibodies itself. And as a result, the antibodies it "borrows" will provide protection or help to fight an infection, but only for a short period of time.
Passive immunization usually lasts for a few weeks or months, after which those borrowed or donated antibodies get broken down by the host body within about 30 days.
The person returns to being at risk of infection by the same pathogen, because their own immune system has not been stimulated to produce its own, more permanent antibodies. Patients who survive a Covid-19 infection with passive immunization would still be at risk of re-infection, unlike patients who had been infected and fought off the disease with their own immune system actively producing the antibodies.
Nobel Prize for blood serum therapy
Passive immunization was first introduced by Emil von Behring, a German immunologist and serologist, in 1890. He developed it for diphtheria, a highly infectious, bacterial disease, responsible for the death of thousands of children back then.
Emil von Behring was awarded the first Nobel Prize for medicine in 1901. For his successes in the development of blood serum-derived medicines against diphtheria and tetanus, von Behring was hailed by the press as the "savior of children" and during World War I as the "savior of soldiers."
Used against Ebola and bird flu
Serum therapy was used in 2014 at the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
Four years later, during another outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a drug consisting of antibodies was used to treat patients and prevented the virus from spreading in the body. That's said to have reduced the mortality rate by 30 percent.
Researchers now want to use antibodies extracted from the blood serum of recovered coronavirus patients to offer a passive immunization against the new disease.
And the work has begun.
In Japan, the drug manufacturer Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. says it plans to obtain an antibody mixture called TAK-888 from the blood plasma of recovered coronavirus patients and use it to develop a new drug.
Takeda is also producing a drug called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for the treatment of patients with immune disorders. Experts say Takeda's approach is promising, as their drug consists of various purified antibodies. That means that researchers do not have to spend time and effort identifying the antibodies needed to fight diseases, such as the new coronavirus.
A Californian competitor, Vir Pharmaceuticals, has taken a similar approach. The American biotechnology company is testing whether antibodies obtained in 2003 from the blood serum of former SARS patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2.
SARS and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) are both severe acute respiratory syndromes, so there could be useful similarities in the antibodies.
Vir is collaborating with WuXi Biologics, a company in China, where the new coronavirus was first detected. The 2003 SARS predominantly affected southern parts of China.
Does serum therapy replace vaccination?
While drugs to treat patients with Covid-19, and vaccines to prevent infection are being developed, a fast-acting, stopgap serum therapy could be useful as a first aid for high-risk patients.
High risks groups include older people, around the ages of 70 or 80, and people with existing, serious conditions, and that may also include younger people.
Experts say an antibody drug could reach a large number of potential patients quickly, because it can be produced quickly in huge cell tanks.
But it will take a vaccine to slow and eventually stop the transmission of this new coronavirus, and labs around the world are currently working on that at full speed.
Coronavirus: Remdesivir is no miracle cure
While Remdesivir reduces the mortality rate and the duration of the illness COVID-19, it's no magic remedy. Now a prematurely leaked WHO study confirms earlier research results.
Soon after the very first cases of coronavirus infections in China, attentions turned to Remdesivir as a potential drug to treat the illness. Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola infections, but it also showed effectiveness  against SARS and MERS coronaviruses in laboratory tests. The new SARS-CoV-2 is considered a variant of the 2002 SARS pathogen.
The drug was developed by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences as GS-5734. At the outset of the pandemic, it was not approved by any country.
It has since been used in the context of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), as well as in the context of scientific studies in numerous countries. Gilead Sciences gave the drug the brand name Veklury in Autumn 2020. 
After an initial clinical trial in the US showed positive results in May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the EUA. Since then, Remdesivir was able to be used in hospitals for the treatment of individual patients with the lung disease COVID-19 outside clinical trials.  
The World Health Organization (WHO) published a non-peer-reviewed preprint study on MedRxiv  on October 15, 2020 showing that Remdesivir barely reduces the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. The study is a result of the so-called 'SOLIDARITY Trial' in which the data of 11,266 patients was evaluated. 
Gilead Sciences in a statement  argued that by having the study published as a preprint, "the data from this open-label global trial have not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion."
Gilead Sciences filed an application for regular approval of the drug with the FDA on August 7, 2020. It has not yet been approved. 
How does Remdisivir work? 
The antiviral effect of Remdesivir derives from its function as a so-called nucleotide analogue. The active substance inhibits the RNA polymerase (RdRp) of viruses such as Ebola and MERS because its structure is similar to RNA building blocks. During virus replication, these are erroneously incorporated into the genetic strands of the new virus copies. Truly functional new viruses cannot be created in this way.
Although Remdesivir did not prove to be really effective in fighting Ebola, cell culture experiments and initial experiments on macaques showed that it had a promising effect against the coronaviruses SARS and MERS-CoV, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Early clinical trials with Remdesivir carried out in the US and China were intended to show if the drug also helps against COVID-19.
White House celebrates positive effects
Initial positive results of an early randomized clinical trial in the US were announced on April 29, 2020 directly from the White House in Washington DC. Speaking about Remdesivir at a press conference with US President Donald Trump at the White House, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Anthony Fauci, then stated: "This will be the standard of care."
A total of 1,063 patients with varying degrees of severity of the disease had taken part in the NIAID-funded study, the "Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial"'Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial' and were treated with Remdesivir or a placebo for 10 days.
The results were similar, albeit not quite as clear as those from the new NEJM study. According to NIAID, preliminary results suggested that COVID-19 patients receiving Remdesivir had, on average, a 31% faster recovery time than patients given the placebo. Patients that received Remdesivir had an average recovery time of 11 days and patients receiving the placebo had an average recovery time of 15 days.
The mortality rate in the Remdesivir-treated group was 8% compared to 11.6% in the placebo group.
Trials ended prematurely
Those responsible for the trials then considered them sufficient. The National Institutes of Health in the US said that the results were meaningful enough. At a meeting of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) on April 27, 2020 it was decided to terminate the study prematurely. 
In parallel with the successful reports from Washington, there were additional reports from China, where Remdesivir was first tested for its efficacy in randomized clinical trials in Wuhan on patients in intensive care units suffering from severe cases of COVID-19.
Eventually, however, Wuhan lacked the necessary patients because of a sharp decline in new infections, and that study was also terminated prematurely, according to a report in The Lancet. 
What do the results mean?
Both the early two studies, as well as the more recent published and leaked studies, seem to point to the same conclusion: The active substance Remdesivir has clearly proven to be moderately effective. It reduces the death rate slightly but not significantly and it reduces the duration of the disease by a few days.
Although this is encouraging, it is far from being the resounding success that many had hoped for from what was described as the most promising drug candidate to date.
"For patients with a severe form of this disease, this study gives hope that they will be able to recover from the infection more quickly and safely," he said. "The yardstick for the effectiveness of potential other drugs will, in the future, be Remdesivir." 
"The results of the large-scale SOLIDARITY study from the WHO with 11,266 patients included worldwide are not entirely unexpected, but no less disappointing" Clemens Wendtner, chief physician for infectiology and tropical medicine at the Munich Municipal Hospital said.
"Despite the limitation that no detailed data are available on the preprint server to date and a peer review process is still pending, it can be stated that the study has failed to meet its primary endpoint: None of the four drugs tested — Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, Lopinar/Ritonavir, and IFN-ß1a - are capable of reducing COVID-19 mortality in symptomatic patients requiring hospital treatment," said Wendtler about the most recent study. 
How Vietnam is winning its 'war' on coronavirus
A densely populated neighbor of China, Vietnam has a weak healthcare system and a low budget for combating the coronavirus. So how has it managed to keep its COVID-19 infection rate so low?
As the coronavirus pandemic rages in wealthy European countries, more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) from China where the outbreak began, Vietnam has widely been spared.
In Germany alone, the latest numbers from the Johns Hopkins University show over 134,000 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, resulting in more than 3,800 fatalities. Vietnam, which shares a 1,100-kilometer-long border with China, however, has only reported 268 infections and no fatalities since the outbreak began in January.
Even if we consider these numbers with a dose of caution, one thing is clear: Vietnam has done a good job thus far in fighting the coronavirus.
During the Tet New Year celebrations at the end of January, Vietnam's government said it was "declaring war" on the coronavirus, although the outbreak at that time was still confined to China. Premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc said during a meeting of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party that it would not be long before the coronavirus reached the country. "Fighting this epidemic, means fighting the enemy," said Phuc.
Mobilizing on all fronts
However, this fight will depend on a lot of government funding and a stout public health system, which are two things that Vietnam lacks.
Vietnam does not have the capacity to undertake a South Korea-style fight against coronavirus, which has so far involved carrying out 350,000 tests. The country's medical system is also limited. Nguyen Thanh Phong, the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis of 8 million people, said that the city's hospitals have a total of 900 intensive care beds. An epidemic in the city would easily overwhelm this capacity.
For example, on February 12, Vietnam put an entire town of 10,000 near Hanoi under quarantine for three weeks. At this time, there were only 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Authorities also widely and meticulously documented anyone who potentially came in contact with the virus.
Western countries like Germany only documented those infected and their direct contacts. Vietnam also kept track of second, third and fourth levels of contact to infected persons. All of these people were then placed under successively stringent levels of movement and contact restrictions.
And from very early on, anyone arriving in Vietnam from a high-risk area would be quarantined for 14 days. All schools and universities have also been closed since the beginning of February.
War rhetoric
Vietnam is also applying a kind of war rhetoric in its fight against coronavirus. The premier has said: "Every business, every citizen, every residential area must be a fortress to prevent the epidemic."
This has hit a nerve with many Vietnamese, who are proud of their ability to stand together in a crisis and endure hardships. The Health Ministry even sponsored a song on YouTube about proper hand-washing that has gone viral.
Following the rules
Although there are no studies to prove it, the mood on social media and conversations with Vietnamese indicate that the majority of the public agrees with the government measures.
They are proud that Vietnam is faring comparatively well in meeting the crisis. The country's most popular coronavirus fighter, vice Premier Vu Duc Dam, has been celebrated on Facebook as a "national hero."
There are few people who are bothered by the fact that this success gives a political advantage to Vietnam's one-party Communist government, which is accused of violating civil rights. People are also accepting stricter control of the media.
The projected economic costs, which will hit Vietnam hard despite the low case numbers, have also been widely accepted by the population.
According to government figures, 3,000 businesses have closed in the first two months of 2020. To ease the burden, Vietnam's government has made $1.1 billion (€1 billion) available to pump liquidity into the economy. However, finance officials expect that tax revenues will dry up because of the crisis. The government is also calling for voluntary donations — and people are giving what they can because they believe in their government during this crisis and in the fight against coronavirus. 
The immune system's fight against the coronavirus
A central player in the fight against the novel coronavirus is our immune system. It protects us against the invader and can even be helpful for its therapy. But sometimes it can turn against us.
How does our immune system react to the coronavirus?
The coronavirus is — like any other virus — not much more than a shell around genetic material and a few proteins. To replicate, it needs a host in the form of a living cell. Once infected, this cell does what the virus commands it to do: copy information, assemble it, release it.
But this does not go unnoticed. Within a few minutes, the body's immune defense system intervenes with its innate response: Granulocytes, scavenger cells and killer cells from the blood and lymphatic system stream in to fight the virus. They are supported by numerous plasma proteins that either act as messengers or help to destroy the virus.
For many viruses and bacteria, this initial activity of the immune system is already sufficient to fight an intruder. It often happens very quickly and efficiently. We often notice only small signs that the system is working: We have a cold, a fever. 
Interferons are a subgroup of signaling proteins that are normally secreted by infected cells. SARS-CoV-1, which was responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2003, appears to have suppressed the production of one of these interferons and thus at least delayed the attraction of immune cells. To what extent this is also the case with SARS-CoV-2, the name given to the coronavirus behind the current pandemic, is still unclear. However, interferons support the body's own virus defense and are now being tested as a therapy in clinical trials.
At a certain point, however, the host response is so strong that its effect can be counterproductive. For example, numerous immune cells can enter our lungs and cause the membrane through which oxygen normally passes from the air into the blood to thicken. The exchange of gases is restricted, and in the worst case, ventilation may be necessary.
Sometimes the reaction can overshoot and be directed against healthy cells as well. This could also be the case with the novel coronavirus. So drugs are also being tested that suppress an excessive immune reaction and that are already known from the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The balance between protective and overly aggressive immune processes in dealing with the coronavirus is currently a big mystery. This must now be investigated, says Achim Hörauf, Director of the Institute of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology at the University of Bonn. 
After a time delay, the acquired immune system finally sets itself in motion. It is different for every person and depends on what we have experienced and with which pathogens we have come into contact. While T cells help destroy infected cells, B cells form antibodies that can keep the virus in check. In the case of the coronavirus, these are neutralizing antibodies that bind to the spike protein of the virus. This is the site of attack of the virus, with which it enters the host, i.e. our human cell. Neutralizing antibodies specifically incapacitate the spike protein. Our immune system remembers the antibodies it has produced and is thus prepared for a new infection with the same intruder.
Is there an immunity? How long does it last?
The good news is that it is very likely there is an immunity. This is suggested by the proximity to other viruses, epidemiological data and animal experiments. Researchers infected four rhesus monkeys, a species close to humans, with SARS-CoV-2. The monkeys showed symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, developed neutralizing antibodies and recovered after a few days. When the recovered animals were reinfected with the virus, they no longer developed any symptoms: They were immune. 
The bad news: It is not yet known how long the immunity will last. It depends on whether a patient has successfully developed neutralizing antibodies. Achim Hörauf estimates that the immunity should last at least one year. Within this year, every new contact with the virus acts as a kind of booster vaccination, which in turn might prolong the immunity.
"The virus is so new that nobody has a reasonable immune response," says the immunologist. He believes that lifelong immunity is unlikely. This "privilege" is reserved for viruses that remain in the body for a long time and give our immune system a virtually permanent opportunity to get to know it. Since the coronavirus is an RNA (and not a DNA) virus, it cannot permanently settle in the body, says Hörauf.
The Heidelberg immunologist Stefan Meuer predicts that the novel coronavirus will also mutate like all viruses. He assumes that this could be the case in 10 to 15 years: "At some point, the acquired immunity will no longer be of any use to us because then another coronavirus will return, against which the protection that has now been formed will not help us because the virus has changed in such a way that the antibodies are no longer responsible. And then no vaccination will help either."
How can we take advantage of the antibody response of the immune system?
Researchers are already collecting plasma from people who have successfully survived an infection with SARS-CoV-2 and are using it to treat a limited number of patients suffering from COVID-19. The underlying principle: passive immunization. The studies carried out to date have shown positive results, but they have usually been carried out on only a few people. 
At best, passive immunization is used only when the patient's own immune system has already started to work against the virus, says Achim Hörauf: "The longer you can leave the patients alone with the infection before you protect them with passive immunization, the better." Only through active immunization can one be protected in the long term. At the same time, it is difficult to recognize the right point in time.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests are currently used to find out whether a person is infected with the coronavirus. With the help of PCR, it is not possible to tell whether or not there is reproducible viral RNA; it is just a proof of whether the virus is still present, dead or alive. 
A PCR test cannot tell us whether our immune system has already intervened, i.e. whether we have had contact with the virus in the past, have formed antibodies and are now protected. Researchers are therefore working on tests that check our blood for the presence of antibodies. They are already in use in Singapore, for example, and are nearing completion in the USA. With the help of these tests, it would finally be possible to gain an overview of the unclear case numbers. In addition, people who have developed antibodies against the virus could be used at the forefront of health care, for example. An "immunity passport" is even under discussion.
Is it possible to become infected and/or ill several times with the coronavirus?
"According to all we know, it is not possible with the same pathogen," says Achim Hörauf. It is possible to become infected with other coronaviruses or viruses from the SARS or MERS group if their spike proteins look different. "As far as the current epidemic is concerned, it can be assumed that people who have been through COVID-19 will not become ill from it for the time being and will not transmit the virus any further,"  he says.
How long before you're no longer contagious?
A study carried out on the first coronavirus patients in Germany showed that no viruses that are capable of replication can be found from day eight after the onset of symptoms, even though PCR can still detect up to 100,000 gene copies per sample. This could change the current quarantine recommendations in the future.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, patients can currently be discharged from hospital if they show two negative PCR samples from the throat within 24 hours. If they have had a severe case of the disease, they should remain in domestic isolation for another two weeks. For each discharge, whether from hospital or home isolation, they should have been symptom-free for at least 48 hours.
Why do people react differently to the virus?
While some people get off with a mild cold, others are put on ventilators or even die of SARS-Cov-2. Especially people with pre-existing conditions and older people seem to be worst-affected by the virus. Why? This is the hottest question at the moment.
It will still take a very, very long time to understand the mechanistic, biological basis for why some people are so much more severely affected than others, virologist Angela Rasmussen told The Scientist. "The virus is important, but the host response is at least as important, if not more important," her colleague Stanley Perlman told the magazine.
Stefan Meuer sees a fundamental survival principle of nature in the different equipment and activity of our immune systems: "If we were all the same, one and the same virus could wipe out the entire human species at once. Due to the genetic range, it is quite normal that some people die from a viral disease while others do not even notice it. "
Achim Hörauf also suspects immunological variants that could be genetically determined. Since interstitial pneumonia is observed with the coronavirus, the focus is probably on an overreaction of the immune system. However, it is also possible that each person affected may have been loaded with a different dose of the virus, which in turn leads to different outcomes. And finally, it makes a difference how robust the body and lungs are: Competitive athletes simply have more lung volume than long-time smokers. 
Coronavirus: How Japan keeps COVID-19 under control
Despite its proximity to China, Japan hasn't seen the massive outbreak of the coronavirus that has shut down much of Europe and North America. What are the Japanese doing differently to help slow the spread?
Coronavirus concerns weren't on the mind of the many people enjoying Japan's famed cherry blossoms this past weekend. Thousands of people sat under the pink splendor in parks and along avenues, eating their packed lunches, drinking beer and snapping selfies with the budding blossoms.
"Hanami, the flower show, is the most important event of the year for us Japanese," said an employee at Ueno Park in Tokyo.
The contrast to Europe could hardly be greater. Japan so far has 10 outbreak clusters, with close to 1,200 confirmed cases and 43 deaths to the coronavirus as of March 24. Only a few dozen new infections are reported every day. These figures should have exploded — after all, Japan is very densely populated, with the world's highest density of senior citizens. And it's in close contact with nearby China, where the disease originated: in January, some 925,000 Chinese people traveled t to Japan, while another 89,000 made the trip in February.
Responding to the coronavirus pandemic, the Japanese government closed all schools two weeks before the spring holidays at the end of March and canceled all public events. But shops and restaurants could remain open, and few Japanese employees decided to work from home.
Containing the spread
The low numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan initially aroused suspicion that the government was covering up the truth.
"After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the government initially refused to admit the reactor meltdowns," said Barbara Holthus, a sociologist with the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo. "Today, there remains a great distrust of official statements."
Despite having the capacity to make 6,000 diagnostic tests per day, Japan has only tested around 14,000 swabs to date — 20 times fewer than neighboring South Korea, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. Only patients with the most severe symptoms are tested, said Masahiro Kami, a virologist at the Medical Governance Research Institute. That, he added, means the number of unreported cases is very high.
Political scientist Koichi Nakano said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe likely wanted to present Japan as a safe country in order not to lose the Summer Olympics 
Experts at the Health Ministry have repeatedly rejected such criticism, saying they were looking for spikes in COVID-19 cases in order to contain the virus, rather than conducting widespread tests. When the epidemic broke out in a primary school on the northern island of Hokkaido, for example, authorities closed all schools in the prefecture and declared a state of emergency. After three weeks the spread of the virus had been stopped.
"The low number of tests was intended to ensure that health care resources remained available for serious cases of infection," Sebastian Maslow, a German political scientist at the University of Tokyo, told DW.
Masks 'a part of our everyday lives'
Japanese greeting etiquette — a bow instead of a handshake or a kiss on the cheek — has also played a part in slowing the outbreak, as has basic hygiene education taught from an early age.
"Washing our hands, gargling with a disinfectant solution and wearing masks are part of our everyday lives. We don't need coronavirus to teach us that," said a Japanese mother of two. As a result, it was easy for society to switch to anti-infection mode in February when the virus first began to spread. Shops and businesses set up hand sanitizers at the entrance, and it became a civic duty to wear a face mask.
The country typically goes through 5.5 billion face masks every year — 43 per person. Sales of face masks skyrocketed as the virus took hold. Masks have been rationed, and people stand patiently in line waiting for shops to open. Other shops sell strips of fabric and coffee filters, along with instructions for DIY versions.
The Japanese appear to have understood that a person can be infected without showing symptoms, said Michael Paumen, a German business manager who has lived in Japan for many years: "You put the mask on to protect others, so you yourself don't transmit viruses."
The widespread use of face masks appears to have slowed down the spread of not just COVID-19, as indicated by the sharp drop in the number of flu patients in the seven weeks since the outbreak of the coronavirus. A recent study by five Western physicians, including Fabian Svara from the Caesar research group in Bonn and Matthias Samwald from the Medical University in Vienna, found that masks "decrease the transmission of droplets or aerosols containing viral particles by mask wearers."
Apart from social distancing and hand-washing, the experts concluded that face masks could play an important role in slowing down the spread of the virus, pointing out the low infection rates in Japan.
Slow return to normal
In view of this success, Abe last week refrained from declaring a national state of emergency. Since then, the Japanese have slowly been returning to their everyday lives. Tutoring schools are back in operation, with the children sitting apart from each other in well-ventilated rooms. Amusement parks have reopened, but people running a fever are asked to stay away.
Fearing a second wave of infections, the government has said that, for the time being, only schools in areas without COVID-19 patients will be allowed to open at the beginning of the new school semester in April. A ban remains prohibiting large public events.
Foreign visitors, however, remain a threat according to health authorities, with South Koreans and EU citizens barred from entering the country. Foreigners who live in Japan are allowed to return but must remain in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. According to unofficial information, the measures will remain in place until at least the end of April.
Vietnam records first Covid-19 deaths
Vietnam has recorded its first Covid-19 fatalities, in a devastating blow for a country proud of its zero deaths. 
The first man, who was aged 70, was from the central city of Hoi An, state media said on Friday.
A second death, of a 61-year-old man, was reported later in the day.
There had been no new locally transmitted infections for more than three months, before an outbreak was reported in the nearby resort of Da Nang earlier this week.
Both of the patients who died had underlying health conditions, according to Vietnamese media.
The country, which has a population of around 95 million, has reported just 546 cases since the pandemic began.
Unlike many other countries, Vietnam acted before it even had confirmed cases, closing its borders early to almost all travelers, except returning citizens. Anyone entering the country must quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing.
And for a while, with no new local transmissions reported since mid-April.
The country received praise for both its timely efforts to contain the virus and for the care it was able to offer.
But earlier this week came the difficult news that new cases had been discovered in the popular resort of Da Nang.
Tens of thousands of tourists from across the country were in the city at the time, many of whom believed the threat from coronavirus had passed.
The government initially closed the city to visitors, before ordering a total local lockdown on Wednesday.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned that every province and city in the country following the outbreak in Da Nang.
"We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak," state media quoted him as saying.
Coronavirus Vietnam: The mysterious resurgence of Covid-19
In mid-July, Vietnam still shone as a Covid-19 outlier. No reported deaths, and months without a locally transmitted case.
Fans packed into football stadiums, schools had reopened, and customers returned to their favourite cafes.
"We were already back to normal life," said Mai Xuan Tu, a 27-year-old from Da Nang in central Vietnam.
Like many in the coastal city wildly popular with domestic visitors, she works in the tourism industry and was slowly resuming bookings for the tour company she founded.
But by the end of July, Da Nang was the epicentre of a new coronavirus outbreak, the source of which has stumped scientists. Cases suddenly surged after 99 straight days with no local transmissions. Last week the city saw the country's first Covid-19 death, a toll that has since risen to 10.
Successful response
Just weeks earlier, Vietnam was praised globally as a rare pandemic success story.
The country acted fast and decisively where other nations faltered, closing its borders to almost all travellers except returning citizens as early as March.
It quarantined and tested anyone who entered the country in government facilities, and conducted widespread contact-tracing and testing nationwide.
So what went wrong?
"I'm not sure anything went wrong," says Prof Michael Toole, an epidemiologist and principal research fellow at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne.
Most countries that thought they had the pandemic under control have seen resurgences, he says, pointing to a long list including Spain, Australia and Hong Kong.
Around 80,000 visitors in Danang - many of whom had relaxed into thinking the disease was contained - were flown home promptly after the new cases emerged, as the historic port city sealed itself off from visitors and retreated into full lockdown.
Vietnam's spike shows that "once there's a little crack and the virus gets in it can just spread so quickly," Prof Toole says.
Scientists and researchers across the country are racing to find out exactly how it did.
In Hanoi Prof Rogier van Doorn, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, says the source of this latest outbreak remains a "big mystery".
His team works with the government on its infectious diseases programmes and some of them focus on what he calls "genetic detective work" - the sequencing of viruses that can help illuminate "the chains of transmission. Who or where the virus came from".
But so far no-one knows how the first new case in Da Nang - a 57-year-old man known as patient 416 - came into contact with the coronavirus.
National pride
A more likely possibility, say researchers, is that the virus went undetected during the months where there were no reported cases, potentially being asymptomatically transmitted in the community. Or there could have been an error somewhere along the quarantine process with someone released prematurely.
"There's evidence that the virus was circulating in Da Nang for several weeks before that first case was diagnosed," says Dr Justin Beardsley, a senior lecturer in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney whose research has focused on Vietnam.
There could be some element of people dropping their guard, he adds, while noting that Vietnam showed exceptionally strong community engagement when it came to curbing spread of the virus.
"There was big national pride about controlling the pandemic. And I think that's been missing in some Western countries."
Since hovering around the 400 mark in late July, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Vietnam has surged above 780. The deputy health minister has said they expect numbers to rise and forecast on Wednesday that the epidemic will reach a peak in 10 days.
With the recent tourists to Da Nang now back at home, cases have been detected in a total of 14 cities and provinces including the capital and Ho Chi Minh City.
But it has been reassuring, says Prof Van Doorn, that all new cases in other parts of the country so far have had a direct link to the Da Nang outbreak. Crucially, there has been no reported community transmission outside of the city and bordering province. This is something authorities will be monitoring closely.
"What was successful before is being done again. I'm again impressed," he adds.
'The year we look after our health'
Speckled among the praise showered on Vietnam for its handling of Covid-19 were some questions about the accuracy of the authoritarian state's data, which medical and diplomatic communities had widely agreed was reliable.
"The new deaths reported shows that there is transparency in reporting Covid-19 in Vietnam and that previous 'no deaths' should have not been questioned in the first place," Dr Huong Le Thu, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, tells the BBC.
All the fatalities so far have been older patients with co-morbidities.
In Da Nang residents are readjusting. The beaches and streets are virtually empty once again as people only leave home to buy food. All eateries have been closed, including for takeout and deliveries. Flights are grounded.
Each resident is set to be tested for the virus, and a field hospital has been erected as every resource is thrown at slowing the spread of the disease.
Freedoms mostly remain intact in other parts of the country, though Hanoi has closed down bars and karaoke parlours as an extra precaution, and several cities including the capital and Ho Chi Minh City have made face masks compulsory again in public places.
Like many worldwide, Xuan Tu is rolling with the uncertainty triggered by the pandemic.
"This year is now the year we look after our health. Focus on family. The things that are most important," she says.
Covid-19: Italy tightens rules after coronavirus cases surge
Italy has announced a new raft of measures to tighten restrictions amid a surge in coronavirus cases.
A mask-wearing PM Giuseppe Conte said the measures were needed "to avoid a new lockdown".
Mayors will get powers to close public areas after 21:00 and the opening times of restaurants and the size of groups allowed will tighten.
The moves came as Italy recorded its highest daily infection rate for the second day in a row.
Another 11,705 new cases were announced on Sunday, beating the previous record, which came a day earlier on Saturday, of 10,925.
Italy was the European nation hardest hit at the start of the pandemic. It has now recorded 414,000 confirmed coronavirus cases. Its 36,500 deaths place it second to only the UK in Europe.
What did Mr Conte say?
The prime minister said in a televised address on Sunday evening: "We cannot waste time, we must put in place measures to avoid a generalised lockdown, which could severely compromise the economy.
"The government is here but everyone has to do their part."
He added: "The most effective measures remain the basic precautions: mask, distance and hand hygiene. We must pay attention to situations where we let our guard down - with relatives and friends. In these situations, the maximum precaution is required."
How is Europe coping with a surge in cases?
A number of nations have strengthened their approach to coronavirus as the so-called "second wave" of infections continues to increase.
France saw a record number of new cases on Saturday at 32,427 and there was close to another 30,000 on Sunday.
However, the rise in confirmed cases in Europe has to be set against the vastly increased testing that is now taking place compared to the first big wave back in March.
Nine major French cities, including the capital Paris, are under a 21:00 to 06:00 curfew for at least a month. Anyone out then must have a valid reason or could be fined €135.
Switzerland on Sunday reacted to a sharp increase in infections by making the wearing of face-coverings in indoor public spaces compulsory from Monday. Gatherings of more than 15 people in public are also banned.
The Czech Republic said on Sunday it would wait two weeks before deciding on whether a full lockdown was needed. The country currently has the highest coronavirus infection rate in Europe and has closed most of the hospitality sector and moved schools to distance-learning.
Ireland is set to announce tighter restrictions on Monday. A minister said a localised policy had not been sufficient and implied the cabinet was looking at a "level four" approach that would close all non-essential businesses.
Germany hit a daily record of new infections on Saturday and Chancellor Angela Merkel urged people to stay at home and avoid travel where possible.
In the Netherlands, PM Mark Rutte admitted he should have given better advice to the royal family after they cut short a trip to Greece amid public anger that they were holidaying shortly after the government had introduced a partial lockdown.
Where have Vietnamese traveled during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Vietnamese people traveled an average of 629km per booking in 2020.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the country to shutter its borders, Vietnamese holidaymakers have had to adjust their 2020 itineraries, shifting their plan from overseas visits to domestic destinations.
A recent survey by booking.com showed the average travel distance traveled by Vietnamese travelers per booking was 629km in 2020, 303km less than the same period last year.
The survey also showed Vietnamese people are favoring big cities and well-known destinations, with Ho Chi Minh City, Ha Noi, Vung Tau, Da Nang, and Da Lat amongst the top travel hotspots in June to August.
Anthony Lu, regional director for booking.com in Vietnam, said Vietnamese people are still busy traveling despite the unpredictable pandemic.  
“Shortly after Vietnam started easing travel restrictions, we found that Vietnamese people, as well as foreigners living in Vietnam, were eager to travel,” Lu said.
Ho Chi Minh City
Ho Chi Minh City is known as Vietnam’s trade and financial hub.
With a modern and vibrant urban life, the city enthralls visitors with the esthetic charm of its historical architecture and artistic cityscape.
Its colorful night eateries and nightlife venues mean there is always something new and exciting to see.
Travelers visiting the city are often awed by its street eats and wide range of affordable restaurants for diners of all ages.
Hanoi
Apart from wandering around the Old Quarter, visitors to Hanoi can enjoy the city’s dozens of historical landmarks, including the Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural, also known as Hanoi’s Ceramic Road.
The 3.85km road running alongside the Red River was recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ‘world's largest ceramic mosaic’ in 2010.
For those looking for a quiet place to relax, West Lake’s signature cafés offer a peaceful atmosphere with great drinks and snacks.
Vung Tau
Vung Tau is a popular weekend getaway for Saigonese looking to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.
This coastal city is just 90 minutes by bus from the southern metropolis.
Although being famous for its beaches and seafood, Vung Tau has other 'hidden gems' such as its lighthouse and the Robert Taylor Museum of Worldwide Arms.
Da Nang
Da Nang offers a fascinating vacation destination filled with many iconic sites like the 67m-high Lady Buddha statue at Linh Ung pagoda, known for being the tallest Buddha statue in Vietnam.
Travelers may also embark on a luxurious railway adventure aboard The Vietage, a railway line that links the ancient town of Hoi An with the sparkling shores of Quy Nhon.
Da Lat
This mesmerizing city is not only famous for its splendid French-style villas but also other monuments and leisure activities.
The cool weather is what makes this Central Highlands city fit for tea farming, perfect for those loving to try making their own matcha drink.
Quarantine issues hinder Vietnam from operating regular inbound flights
Passengers arrive on a commercial flight from South Korea at Tan Son Nhat Airport in Ho Chi Minh City in this photo taken in September 2020. 
Domestic airlines have once again suspended inbound services, shortly after the resumption in late September
Domestic airlines have once again suspended inbound services, shortly after the resumption of two commercial flights between South Korea and Vietnam in late September.
The suspension is the result of inconsistent management and quarantine protocols for inbound flight passengers, the Ministry of Transport said.
Further guidelines from relevant agencies are needed to restore the flights, the ministry added.
Quarantine price disputes
Since the country closed its borders since March to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Vietnam has still received a handful of inbound flights under three categories - rescue flights, exclusive flights for foreign experts, or commercial flights.
To board rescue flights, passengers must sign up at Vietnamese embassies overseas and wait for approval.
Meanwhile, flights for experts and commercial flights do not set any requirements for passengers.
Phan Thanh Tam, deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control, said all entrants into Vietnam are subject to a chargeable quarantine period, excluding those on rescue flights.
The recent arrival of 262 passengers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City from South Korea marked the resumption of regular commercial flights to Vietnam after previous suspension, a leader of a domestic airline said.
However, the inconsistencies in quarantine fees at hotels met with a backlash from passengers, he added.
The Southern Airports Corporation, which manages Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City, reported that there were passengers deliberately picking a quarrel to avoid hotel quarantine in an effort to enter collective quarantine centers, where the 14-day quarantine service is offered at a much lower price.
Meanwhile, some Vietnam Airlines passengers on September 25 said that they had bought tickets and transferred money for hotel quarantine. However, they were sent to military bases upon arrival at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi, with their deposits returned by the hotels.
Passengers of budget carrier VietJet said they should have been quarantined at the hotels in Ho Chi Minh City that they had paid for, but they were sent to centralized isolation in outlying Can Gio District instead.
During his stay in Can Gio after leaving South Korea for Ho Chi Minh City on September 30, passenger N.T.D. said he had not received transparent information on hotel quarantine fees before buying flight tickets.
Arriving in Ho Chi Minh City, he found hotel charges fluctuating rapidly and ending up unaffordable to many people.
“Not everyone can afford a stay in a hotel at VND1.3 million [$56] per day, even up to VND1.7 million [$73.3] per day in 14 days in a row [for the required quarantine period],” he elaborated.
Airline-hotel cooperation
While the quarantine protocols for flight passengers remain under consideration, accommodation and quarantine fees are attributed the recent disruption of international flights.
Many passengers said they could not pay for quarantine fees at high-end hotels in the country.
Nguyen Thi Anh Hoa, deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Tourism, said hotels chosen for quarantine services will have to post their rates publicly.
Entrants into Vietnam are required to present their quarantine plan, including destinations, quarantine facilities, means of transport, and hotel bookings.
To avoid arising problems, Vietnam Airlines proposes a partnership between its certified flight ticket agencies and lodging facilities to arrange quarantine tour packages with various options in flight and hotel services.
This will ensure proper quarantine for passengers upon their arrival in Vietnam.
In another note, a working group from the Ministry of Health is developing a unified quarantine protocol on a nationwide scale, which will be submitted to the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control for approval.
Anti-lockdowners protest as London COVID alert level is raised
Anti-lockdown demonstrators gathered in central London on Saturday, hours after the British capital moved to the second highest COVID-19 alert level.
As a second wave of infections gathers pace, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has stepped up local restrictions in parts of England where cases are surging - hoping to shield the economy by allowing the least-affected regions to remain open.
As of midnight, London was moved up to the “tier 2” or “high-risk” level. This bans people from meeting anybody outside their household or “support bubble” - including friends or relatives who help to care for children - in any indoor setting.
The rules also forbid more than six people to meet outdoors, though the police chose not to enforce them as several thousand anti-lockdown campaigners marched down Oxford Street, one of the world’s busiest shopping streets in normal times.
The protesters view COVID-19 restrictions as unnecessary and a breach of their human rights. Some oppose mask-wearing and vaccinations.
Some carried placards saying: “MY BODY MY CHOICE, NO TO MANDATORY MASKS”.
“There’s plenty of things that can kill you, you know, it could happen any day,” said protester Aragorn Kyley, 17. “It’s about living, not just surviving. We want to be able to enjoy our lives, not just be stuck at home.”
As of Saturday, 57% of the United Kingdom’s population was living under tighter COVID-19 restrictions.
However scientists from the SAGE group that advises the government, and the main opposition Labour Party, want ministers to go further and impose a short nationwide lockdown or so-called “circuit breaker” for the spread of the disease.
Vietnam cancels 2020 F1 race due to COVID-19 pandemic
A man wears a protective mask as he guards at the construction site of Formula One Vietnam Grand Prix racing track in Hanoi, Vietnam March 12, 2020. 
Vietnam’s first Formula One grand prix has been officially cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, organisers said on Friday.
The Vietnamese Grand Prix was originally scheduled to take place in April on the streets of Hanoi as the third race of the season, but sources told Reuters in March that it was under threat.
“This has been an extremely difficult but necessary decision to reach in view of the continued uncertainty caused by the global coronavirus pandemic,” Vietnam Grand Prix Corp said in an emailed statement, adding that it would refund all tickets sold.
Vietnam has recorded over 1,110 COVID-19 infections, with 35 deaths, Ministry of Health data showed.
The start of the Formula One season was pushed back to July from March due to the pandemic, with extensive changes made to the 2020 calendar.
The total number of races was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally envisaged, with Vietnam becoming the 13th race from the original calendar to be axed this year.
Hanoi city authorities had hoped to hold the race in November, but Vietnam Grand Prix Corp Chief Executive Le Ngoc Chi said on Friday that cancellation emerged as the only option after a review of safety criteria.
Formula One only finalised its 2020 calendar in August, following six rounds of racing.
The 13 races announced before the final calendar was made public were all in Europe, after all four of the season’s races in the Americas were scrapped.
In its August announcement, Formula One cancelled the Chinese Grand Prix, while adding four more races - one in Turkey, two in Bahrain and one in Abu Dhabi - in the last two months of the year.
Vietnamese universities short of international students amid COVID-19 pandemic
Some international students, among more than 150 ones, take part in the Global Leader Experience held in 2019 by RMIT University Vietnam.
Many Vietnamese universities are struggling against the falling number of international students because of travel restrictions amid the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Normally, local universities admit up to thousands of foreign students each year, who come to Vietnam to take various education programs.
They are poised to create an ideal overseas study destination in competition with regional universities, but have recently encountered a hefty obstacle – COVID-19.
Every year, the faculty of Vietnamese studies of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City, receives thousands of international students who learn about the Vietnamese language and culture.
According to Assoc. Pro. Dr. Doan Le Giang, head of the faculty, although this year's new semester has started, around 50 percent of full-time students, including sophomores and juniors, have not come back.
They are mainly South Koreans, who returned home in February or March when the epidemic developed complicatedly in Southeast Asia.
Student numbers tumble
In the new school year of 2020-21, only about 45 new international students were admitted to the faculty of Vietnamese studies, dropping nearly a half in comparison with last year's number.
Most of the freshmen are residing with their families in Vietnam while there are few students from other regional countries.
The pandemic has affected not only full-time students but also those participating in the 2+2 program, which means two years in Vietnam and two years in their home countries.
"They couldn’t come to Vietnam for the second semester last year and the situation remains unchanged in this year's first semester," said Dr. Giang.
The number of exchange students, who often register for a short course from two to three weeks, has also declined sharply, which is quite different from previous years.
Dr. Nguyen Trung Hien, head of student affairs under the faculty of international studies of the Vietnam National University-Hanoi, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper it is very difficult to attract international students.
There have been only seven freshmen up to now, Dr. Hien said.
"Although Vietnam has brought the pandemic under control, many international flights have not been resumed," he added.
"As a result, many overseas students keep a wary eye on traveling to Vietnam for this semester. Some of them are not as excited as before.”
Dr. Hien's university received more than 100 students from the U.S. and Canada via student exchange programs last year. The programs, however, have been canceled this year, including study tours and summer schools.
A few international students have met trouble in visa extension, according to Dr. Hien.
In such cases, the university has helped them with entry/exit formalities as requested.
Flying students home on charter flights
In 2019, FPT University admitted about 1,000 international students, mainly via student exchange programs, mostly from Japan, Australia, Malaysia, and Taiwan.
According to Dr. Le Truong Tung, chairman of the FPT University Council, all activities of international training collaboration have come to a standstill this year because of the pandemic.
At the beginning of this year, the pandemic broke out when many international students were participating in student exchange programs at the university.
At the same time, many Vietnamese students were taking part in similar programs in Japan and Malaysia.
As the pandemic could linger for a long time, the university discussed with its partners and decided to let students return home earlier than expected.
The universities were responsible for the preparation and expenses in bringing students home.
The university chartered a flight to send nearly 100 students and lecturers back to Vietnam from Japan in April, before the restrictions of international flights took effect.
The situation of RMIT Vietnam University, however, did not go as smoothly as FPT University.
Many of RMIT's students and lecturers were stranded in Australia for months since the coronavirus outbreak.
It took the university a lot of time to organize a flight carrying 270 students and lecturers from Melbourne to Vietnam, Prof. Peter Coloe, chairman of RMIT Vietnam, told Tuoi Tre.
All the passengers had tested negative for the coronavirus from 3-7 days before boarding.
After landing at Van Don Airport in the northern Vietnamese province of Quang Ninh, they were sent to a central quarantine facility.
"RMIT University Vietnam has been in collaboration with authorities to help our students and lecturers take commercial flights transiting in Asian countries like Singapore and South Korea to come back to Vietnam since the beginning of October, before the start of the new semester," Prof. Coloe.
Ad-hoc solution: going online
Dr. Giang said his university has offered students full online courses, as only around 50 percent of its international students are living in Vietnam.
Despite some advantages, online courses are not as good as normal classes, he remarked.
Regarding teaching Vietnamese, which is believed to be hard to learn, students cannot observe the ways a teacher pronounces. This is really difficult for foreign students.
"As a result, lecturers have to send documents to learners who can use them to learn by themselves," said Giang.
Although FPT University can provide online courses for international students who fail come to Vietnam due to the pandemic, this way of teaching is not as effective as physical classes, Dr. Tung said.
Taking online classes, students will lose the opportunity to experience the Vietnamese culture and society.
Lack of foreign teachers
Many educational institutions in Vietnam have seen a severe shortage of foreign teachers given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The head of the marketing department of an English language school franchise chain in Ho Chi Minh City revealed that ten of their centers have fallen short of more than 50 foreign teachers.
If Hanoi and Da Nang are taken into account, the system is lacking in nearly 200 foreign lecturers.
Travel restrictions to prevent the pandemic have been considered as the main reason for such a dearth.
Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo flies to Italy after testing positive for coronavirus
Cristiano Ronaldo is returning to Turin, Italy, aboard a private air ambulance, after testing positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.
Juventus confirmed on Wednesday that its star forward would be able to continue his isolation at home after his flight from Portugal was authorized by health authorities.
According to the head of Portugal's General Health Directorate, Graça Freitas, such movement is permitted given Ronaldo, who has residency in Italy, organized and paid for his own private transport.
Ronaldo had to submit to an evaluation by health authorities before he left Portugal and sign a term of responsibility. He will be under observation and custody of Italian health officials upon his arrival in Turin.
"These are international procedures, they are quite well typified, the European Union member states are obligated to comply with them, and we comply with them for an anonymous citizen as for a known one," Freitas told journalists at a daily briefing on the state of the pandemic in the country.
Cristiano Ronaldo tests positive for coronavirus
The 35-year-old Ronaldo played for Portugal against France in the Nations League on Sunday and against Spain in a friendly last week.
On Monday, he posted a photo to social media of him sharing a meal with his Portugal teammates.
Following his positive test, the Portuguese Football Federation said Ronaldo was "well, without symptoms, and in isolation."
It also confirmed that every other player subsequently returned a negative test on Tuesday morning.
Ronaldo is now set to miss his country's next Nations League fixture against Sweden on Wednesday, as well as Juventus' upcoming matches which include a Serie A clash with Crotone and a Champions League group game against Dynamo Kyiv.
It comes as Juventus confirmed midfielder Weston McKennie tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, meaning the entire team is isolating until they are tested again.
The Portuguese Football Federation and Ronaldo's representatives were not immediately available for CNN's request for comment.
George Ramsay and Martijn Edelman contributed to this reporting.
She had a heart attack during lockdown and has subsequently been diagnosed with heart failure.
In July, she was told she needed to have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted, which can shock the heart back into rhythm when it detects a potential cardiac arrest.
But 12 weeks on, she is still waiting. "I could have a cardiac arrest at any point," Sarah says.
"It is awful not knowing what is going to happen.
"I am on the urgent list - but the infection rates are rising and the clinics are closing.
"I don't know when I will get it.
"There are so many people in my position - we don't have Covid but our lives are at risk too.
"We are the forgotten victims of this pandemic."
Sharp rise
British Heart Foundation analysis of Office for National Statistics data for England and Wales found almost 800 extra deaths from heart disease among under-65s from March to July - 15% more than would be expected.
The rate of death was highest during the full lockdown - but, worryingly, the trend continued afterwards.
The charity blames delays in people seeking care, as well as reduced access to routine tests and treatments.
And NHS England figures show a sharp rise in the numbers waiting over six weeks for a whole range of key tests, including echocardiograms for hearts.
BHF associate medical director Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan says the consequences of the pandemic have been "tragic".
"Covid has put people with heart and circulatory conditions at greater risk than ever," she says.
And it is essential people seek help if they are worried about their health.
"Don't delay because you think hospitals are too busy," Babu-Narayan says.
"The NHS still has systems in place to safely treat you."
Traumatic impact
Heart disease is not the only condition affected. Similar warnings have been made by patient groups for other conditions.
Macmillan Cancer Support says a drop in referrals for urgent cancer check-ups, people starting treatment and the numbers being screened is threatening to have a "traumatic" impact on people's lives now and in the future.
It is unclear how many lives have been lost for non-Covid reasons.
There were a total of 13,000 non-Covid excess deaths in England and Wales during the first eight weeks of the pandemic.
Since then, overall death rates have returned to close to normal.
But many more people than would be expected are still dying at home.
An extra 28,000 deaths in private homes have been recorded since the pandemic started, which is higher than the excess death toll in care homes.
And a third of them were in July, August and September, when Covid death rates were very low.
The Office for National Statistics is investigating the cause.
The numbers dying in hospital have been lower than expected in recent months, so it may just be people are choosing to die at home.
But the Nuffield Trust says it could also be a sign people are going without vital treatment.
The numbers attending accident-and-emergency units dropped by 50% in April and have still not recovered to normal levels.
Coronavirus: Virus isolation period extended from seven to 10 days
People who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms in the UK must now self-isolate for at least 10 days, rather than seven.
The change, announced by the UK's chief medical officers, comes as ministers try to avoid a resurgence of the virus.
Until now, those showing key symptoms - a new continuous cough, a temperature or loss of taste or smell - have had to self-isolate for at least a week.
The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance.
The chief medical officers said the change is "particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission".
Evidence shows that people with Covid-19 have "a low but real possibility of infectiousness" between seven and nine days after falling ill, they said.
People are most contagious just before they first display symptoms and for the first few days afterwards. But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has "strengthened".
Advice on the length of isolation varies between countries. For example, the Irish Republic says those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days, while in the US those with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever.
It comes after the prime minister warned of signs of a "second wave" of the pandemic in parts of Europe.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to "take a precautionary approach" and "protect people from that wave reaching our shores".
Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, said the change was "vital" and "nobody should be under the illusion that coronavirus has gone away".
The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. An quarantine exemption for health professionals had been in place since June.
There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK, including in Oldham, Wrexham and Staffordshire.
Meanwhile, the government is expected on Friday to announce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Leicester, a month after the city was put into extended lockdown following a spike in cases.
The mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed frustration at the delayed decision, originally expected on Thursday.
"We haven't got a clue what's going on, we really haven't," he said.
The brakes are beginning to come on
Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that, hopefully, we would be back to near-normality by Christmas.
The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing, with pubs and restaurants reopening, as well as a feeling that we seemed to be getting through it.
Now, there's a real sense of the brakes beginning to go on.
We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain. Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they're keeping an eye on Belgium too.
We had restrictions imposed in Oldham to curb the virus there and now there's been an extension of the self-isolation period.
The real apprehension is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may, in time, happen here.
To some extent, that has been the story of coronavirus: we have tended to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe.
Official figures published on Thursday showed that 43,119 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace since its launch in May.
The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77% of these - but just over 23% were not reached.
The figures, from the Department of Health and Social Care, also showed that of 222,589 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive, 83% had been reached and asked to self-isolate.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met, with about three-quarters (76.4%) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22.
For those using home testing kits, 76.9% received results within 48 hours.
But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing, hampering its ability to track outbreaks, because they wrongly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible.
A decision that could have been taken months ago
The UK requirement for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - plenty of other countries require 10 days or even longer.
As coronavirus is new, there is still a lack of certainty over how long someone remains infectious, which is why there are a variety of approaches.
UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a "low, but tangible" risk of transmission from seven to 10 days, even for those with mild to moderate illness.
This is a decision that could have been taken weeks, even months, ago in truth.
But officials are describing it as a "value judgement" based on a variety of reasons.
For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days, the chances of passing it on increases.
The availability of widespread testing also means only those with a positively confirmed infection need to continue isolating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a blanket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate.
But it is about sending an important signal too. Levels of infection are low, but the message is clear: we can't be complacent.
The government is launching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night stressing that anyone with symptoms should get tested, which is free and available to all.
Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests, although some of the untested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms.
Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self-isolate for 14 days.
And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days - a move that has sparked complaints from travel firms.
Ministers are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK, meaning that quarantine and self-isolation time periods could be standardised at 10 days.
Mr Hancock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no imminent changes.
On Thursday evening, Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine-free list, meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land-locked country from midnight will need to self-isolate for two weeks.
A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored.
Leading travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday for coronavirus testing at airports in the UK but the source said that "any new system had to be workable and at the moment it isn't".
Mr Hancock told Breakfast that the "big scientific challenge" with testing arrivals at the border is that people "can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn't show up in a test".
What are the rules on self-isolating?
Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it.
Anyone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days, and those who show symptoms should arrange to get tested.
Symptoms include: a new continuous cough, a high temperature, and a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell.
They should continue to self-isolate if they still feel unwell after that initial period.
Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes.
If you test positive you will be contacted by contact tracers, who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to.
Anybody they deem to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact.
Australian newswire highlights Vietnam’s success in fighting COVID-19 resurgence
The conversation.com reported that Europe could look to the success of countries like Vietnam as the continent is again in the grip of a COVID-19 resurgence.
It highlighted targeted testing as an effective tactic used by Vietnamese health authorities, where they have focused on high-risk individuals and on buildings and neighbourhoods where there have been confirmed cases. Health authorities have also implemented extensive contact tracing, and aimed to identify those at risk of exposure regardless of symptoms.
The country also set up quarantine facilities for infected people and international travellers, minimising spread inside households.
It noted that having experienced the SARS and avian flu epidemics, many Asian countries took the threat of COVID-19 seriously right from the beginning.
In addition, many countries implemented strict mask wearing and physical distancing early. Targeted testing, education and the involvement of the community are critical in responding to COVID-19./.VNA
Many state-owned groups see big losses amid COVID-19 crisis
Many enterprises have reported big losses because of Covid-19, including large state-owned groups.
The government’s report to the National Assembly show a sharp decline in tax and fee collections as businesses have been hit hard by Covid-19. The decrease is also attributed to the policies on tax remissions and tax payment deadline extensions, amounting to VND18.78 trillion.
“The tax collection in the first nine months of the year was the lowest in many years,” the report said. .
The tax and fee collections were just equal to 61.6 percent of the yearly plan, a decrease of 8.1 percent decrease compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, in previous years, the collections of the first nine months of 2016-2019 were 69.7-72 percent of the yearly plans and the collections increased by 7-15.2 percent year after year.
Covid-19, which has seriously affected China, the US and Europe, the biggest partners of Vietnam, has also affected Vietnam trade, especially exports, leading to a decrease of VND35.279 trillion in state budget collection compared with the same period last year.
The price of crude oil fell to below $40 per barrel in the first nine months of the year, causing a considerable decrease to revenue for the state budget.
The government thinks the state budget collection in the last three months of the year will still face difficulties.
The second Covid-19 outbreak occurred in key economic centers, including Da Nang, Quang Nam, Hai Duong, Hanoi and HCM City. And Vietnam’s big trade partners have not controlled the epidemic and as a result Vietnam’s exports and investment will still bear adverse effects.
Eight more imported COVID-19 cases recorded
Vietnam confirmed eight new imported COVID-19 cases from 6am-6pm on October 18, according to the National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control.
They were put under quarantine in Quang Ninh, Tien Giang and Khanh Hoa provinces following their arrivals.
So far, the total number of COVID-19 cases has amounted to 1,134; 691 of them are locally-transmitted. Since July 25, there have been 551 new cases in 15 cities and provinces, including 389 in Da Nang, 96 in Quang Nam, 16 in Hai Duong, 11 in Hanoi, 8 in Ho Chi Minh City, 7 in Quang Tri, 6 in Bac Giang, 5 in Quang Ngai, 4 in Lang Son, 3 in Dak Lak, 2 in Dong Nai, 1 in Thai Binh, Ha Nam, Thanh Hoa and Khanh Hoa each.
Epidemic hotbeds have been controlled in localities. Up to 1,031 cases have been recovered.
Among patients under treatment at medical establishments, seven tested negative to SARS-CoV-2 once, four twice and 12 thrice. The country recorded no cases in critical conditions. The number of faltalities stands at 35.
As many as 13,515 nationwide who had close contact with patients or entered from pandemic-hit areas are under quarantine, 162 of them are in hospitals, 12,166 in other establishments and 1,187 at homes.

All entrants must be placed under medical surveillance for at least 28 days to contain COVID-19
Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam chairs a meeting of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control at the Government Office, Ha Noi, October 15, 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic has yet shown any signs of decline across the globe and is projected to rebound during winter in countries where restrictions are loosened. 
In Viet Nam, the disease has been properly brought under control but it would re-emerge if preventive measures are not seriously enforced, the Government warned. 
Given the backdrop, authorities at all levels and sectors must raise their sense of responsibility, continue to stay vigilant and implement COVID-19 preventive and control measures in order to sustain the country’s outcomes of the COVID-19 fight while accelerating economic recovery, Dam stressed.
Especially, the Deputy PM demanded strict implementation of the regulations on health declaration, quarantine, and medical surveillance for at least 28 days for all entrants from the date of entry. 
The Ministry of Health was tasked to promptly complete a health management system for entrants while local authorities have to direct grass-roots medical facilities to conduct medical surveillance of the entrants.
The ministry and the provincial People’s Committees are responsible for instructing hospitals, medical facilities, and nursing centers to seriously comply with disease prevention regulations.
The ministry was urged to work with relevant ministries to review and update instructions on disease prevention at schools, hotels, public transport means, factories, and working places. 
Viet Nam has gone 43 straight days without community transmission case of COVID-19, according to the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control led by Deputy PM Dam.
As of 6:05 pm on Thursday, the nation reported 1,124 COVID-19 patients, including 1,030 recoveries and 35 fatalities.
Indian expert among two new imported Covid-19 cases in Vietnam
Passengers provide health declarations at Tan Son Nhat Airport in HCMC, March 2020. 
An Indian expert and a Vietnamese man returning from Myanmar, both quarantined upon arrival, are Vietnam’s latest Covid-19 patients, raising the country’s active cases to 57.
"Patient 1125" is a 30-year-old Indian expert who landed October 6 at the Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City from India on IndiGo Airways flight 6E9471, the Health Ministry said Saturday evening.
The man was quarantined at a centralized camp in the city. He had his samples taken for Covid-19 test a day later but the result showed negative.
On October 16, he developed cough and medical staffs took his samples for second Covid-19 testing. The result done by the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases confirmed he was positive for the novel coronavirus and he is being treated at the hospital.
Earlier, 16 Indian experts boarding the same flight were confirmed positive for the virus and they were being treated in Dong Thap and Dong Nai provinces and HCMC in southern Vietnam.
"Patient 1126" is a 37-year-old resident of Quynh Chu District in the northern province of Thai Binh. On October 15, he landed at Cam Ranh Airport in the central province of Khanh Hoa on Vietjet flight VJ2735 from Myanmar and was quarantined at the National Defense Education Center of Nha Trang University.
On October 16, the Khanh Hoa Center for Disease Control took his sample and sent it to Pasteur Nha Trang Institute. The next day, the result came back positive. He is being treated at a medical center of Cam Lam District.
Vietnam also declared a Covid-19 patient recovered on Saturday.
The country has recorded 1,126 coronavirus cases and 1,031 recoveries. Its Covid-19 death toll stands at 35.
Vietnam has gone 45 days without community transmission of the virus. More than 13,000 people are in quarantine at present.
Worldwide, over 39 million people have been infected, with death toll climbing to over 1.1. million.
Assault of coronavirus possibly on next winter: Acting Health Minister
There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter, said Acting Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long.
He made the statement in the ministry’s meeting yesterday with local health departments across the country. It is forecast that the disease will last till end of 2021 and its peak season will be on next winter.
Because there is no officially registered vaccine and drug for Covid-19 prevention and treatment; therefore, it is a big challenge in preventing it.
The Southeast Asian nation has not been free from local coronavirus infections for the last 30 days; yet, people should not practice relaxed behavior as outbreaks of Covid-19 can occur at any time, said Mr. Long.
Accordingly, he noted that local administrations to re-check all possible scenarios of Covid-19 that employees in hospitals, factories get Covid-19.
On the same day, the national steering board for Covid-19 prevention and control said that in the day, the country reported three more cases of Covid-19 including one Malaysian expert and two people from Russia who are being under quarantine in the Southern Province of Bac Lieu and Ba Ria – Vung Tau.
The Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee has just issued the decision 3767 on setting up quarantine wards in paid hotels and restaurants for imported cases.
Phase 3 clinical trial of Vietnamese-made vaccine to be conducted in 2021
Acting Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial of Vietnamese-made vaccine is scheduled to be conducted in 2021.
The Acting Health Minister made the statement at a seminar about vaccine against Covid-19 jointly organized by the Ministry of Health, PATH, an international, nonprofit global health organization, and the British Embassy in Vietnam.
The Southeast Asian country is one of 42 nations in the world to produce vaccine against Covid-19. Positive results from preclinical research supported the rapid development of this vaccine candidates in Vietnam including the Vaccine and Biological Production No. 1 (VABIOTECH), the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals (POLYVAC), the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), and the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology.
Dr. Long revealed according to the World Health Organization’s updates, by September24, 187 kinds of vaccine Covid-19 are being researched globally including 38 of them under clinical trials and 149 under pre-clinical trial. Noticeably, vaccine Covid-19 made by British scientists has been completing third phase clinical trial to supply to countries.
Dr. Long expressed his expectation that Vietnamese government and the UK will exchange and sign agreement in supply of vaccine against Covid-19 in the next time basing on the long-term bilateral strategic cooperation.
In addition to finding vaccine supplies through direct exchange with international producers, Vietnam is promoting manufacturing of vaccine for Vietnamese residents, said Professor Long. Safe and effective vaccines will be essential to meet the local need for widespread protection against Covid-19.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab stressed that cooperation between Vietnamese and British scientists will help protect residents of the two countries as well as prevent the second waves of Covid-19 which has been threatening safety of all people in the globe. The UK promised to provide GBP50 million to Asian countries for the fight against Covid-19 as well as upgrade of health system and restoring economic growth.
US provides ventilators to Vietnam in response to Covid-19
The U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), today donated 100 brand-new ventilators to Vietnam to support its ongoing response to Covid-19.
The donation delivers on President Trump’s generous offer of these critically needed supplies, supports Vietnam’s urgent response to the pandemic. The handover ceremony was attended by U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink, USAID/Vietnam Mission Director Michael Greene, Acting Minister of Health Dr. Nguyen Thanh Long.
The ventilators, produced in the United States, reflect leading-edge and in-demand technology. They are compact, deployable, and provide Vietnam with flexibility in treating patients affected by the virus. For patients whose lungs are not working adequately despite receiving oxygen, this vital resource may prove life-saving.
“The world is impressed by Vietnam’s strategy and proactive measures in tackling Covid-19,” said Ambassador Kritenbrink, “but this serious disease remains a threat in Vietnam and the world. Building on the strong relationship between our countries over the last 25 years, the U.S. Government is pleased to support our friends in Vietnam with this donation of ventilators to fight the coronavirus.”
On his part, Acting Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long emphasized that the gift marks the bilateral cooperation in the health field and prevention of Covid-19. The Ministry allocated the National Lung Hospital to distribute the ventilators.
In addition to the ventilators, the U.S. Government, through USAID, has committed US$9.5 million to Vietnam in response to the pandemic, which is helping to strengthen clinical care, disseminate health messages, build laboratory capacity, improve disease surveillance, as well as support private sector recovery by mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the Vietnamese economy.
Experts, investors arriving in Vietnam to get tested for Covid-19
The Standing National Steering Board of Covid-19 Prevention and Control yesterday stressed at a meeting that experts and investors arriving in Vietnam should be tested for Covid-19 through quick tests at airports and border gates.
The steering board listened to reports of Covid-19 situation, production of biological test kits and experiences from other nations in the fight against Covid-19.
The steering board emphasized that quick testing at airports, hospitals and crowded events is needed to screen infected people when the country welcome investors and experts for the country’s economic growth
Travelers arriving in the Southeast Asian country from regions with an increased risk of infection need to undergo a coronavirus test. It’s possible to get tested right at the airport, free of charge.
Members of the steering board proposed the Ministry of Health to organize testing at airports because Vietnam is going to reopen some international flights.
The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science and Technology and related agencies should facilitate for piloting test kits made by Vietnamese firms. The Ministry of Health was proposed to tighten preventative measures in medical facilitates to curb spread in infirmaries.
The steering board informed the country recorded five new Covid-19 cases yesterday, all imported cases and they were quarantined in a facility in the Southern Province of Ba Ria – Vung Tau. Therefore, the country has not had new community transmission cases in seven days.
In related news, Director of the Department of Health in the Central City of Da Nang Ngo Thi Kim Yen announced yesterday that the city has carried out massive testing of all households to detect infected Covid-19 people. Some 70,972 residents are negative for the virus SARS-CoV-2.
Japan aids Vietnamese hospitals in COVID-19 fight
An exchange note on a non-refundable aid for COVID-19 prevention and control was signed between the Vietnamese and Japanese governments on September 7.
On the behalf of the two governments, Acting Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long and Japanese Ambassador Yamada Takio signed the note.
The ODA grant is worth JPY2 billion  (US$18.8 million ) in total, including JPY1.8 billion for the Vietnamese side and about JPY200 million  for the agents designated by the Japanese Government. It will be disbursed in 18 months, from August 2020 to January 2022.
The assistance aims to provide technical support in upgrading medical equipment at four hospitals of the Vietnamese Health Ministry, namely the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the National Lung Hospital, the Da Nang C Hospital, and the National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, thereby helping to improve their capacity in COVID-19 prevention and control.
Appreciating the grant, Acting Health Minister Long expressed his hope that the equipment will be provided for the hospitals soon, asking them to use the new facilities as efficiently as possible so as to continually improve the quality of health examination and treatment.
For his part, Ambassador Yamada Takio said the Japanese Government highly values the Health Ministry of Vietnam’s role in successfully containing the novel coronavirus in the country although this pandemic is still ravaging around the globe.
He also noted when Japan faced a face mask shortage in spring, the Vietnamese Government supported it with over 1.2 million masks, adding that the Japanese people appreciated the gift.
The grant for the four central hospitals of Vietnam is an initiative of the Japanese Foreign Minister that is meant to supply medical equipment for other countries, including Vietnam, in the fastest manner to promote their healthcare capacity, the diplomat added.
Vietnam to finish formality for human trials of Covid-19 vaccine in next months
Ho Chi Minh City-based Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology has finished vaccine quality testing and sent samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) for re-test and pre-clinical studies.
A group of medical experts from the Ministry of Health led by Head of the Drug Administration of Vietnam Vu Tuan Cuong yesterday worked with the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology located in the Sai Gon Hi-Tech Park in HCMC upon clinical studies, circulation registration and use of Covid-19 vaccine.
The Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology is one of four establishments allowed to make Covid-19 vaccine by Vietnamese Prime Minister.
Covid-19 vaccines produced by four Vietnamese units – the Vaccine and Biological Production No. 1 (VABIOTECH), the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals (POLYVAC), the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), and the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology – have shown positive initial results.
Nanogen Research and Development Director Do Minh Si said that the company has succeeded in making four kinds of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies based on Covid-19 recovered patients’ antibodies.
Mentioning on pre-clinical trial studies of four kinds of single-chain variable fragment antibodies, Director Si said Nanogen has researched and it can now produce scFv antibodies and per-scFv antibodies against RBD of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The company can make 10,000 dozes a week.
According to Director Si, the company has spent VND120 billion (US$5,177,779) including VND75 billion for clinical studies and the remaining for upgrade of its facility and equipment.
Deputy Head of the Ministry of Health’s Department of Technology Science and Training Nguyen Ngo Quang affirmed that the Ministry will effort to help the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology to finish preclinical trial as soon as possible.
He noted Nanogen to finish formality in September or October for human trial.
Chairman advises traders to take proactive measures against Covid-19
Chairman of the People’s Committee in the Central Province of Thua Thien – Hue advised traders of Dong Ba Market to take proactive measures against Covid-19 while he and his officials yesterday paid a visit to the market to check the Covid-19 prevention task.
In a meeting with traders, Chairman Phan Ngoc Tho advised traders to follow the government’ preventative regulations including not contacting closely with others, wearing facemasks and not gathering in crowd. Moreover, traders should refuse to sell commodities to those who don’t wear facemasks.
Mr. Tho also proposed the market management board to educate people about the coronavirus pandemic encouraging traders to adopt preventative measures against Covid-19 to protect their health and the community especially wearing facemasks and not gathering in crowd.
Additionally, traders and consumers were advised to install Bluezone, a mobile app designed to assist in contact tracing, in order to better curb the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreaks according to the Prime Minsiter’s direction.
Furthermore, Chairman Tho asked to renew the market and clean environment around the market’s premises including planting flowers,  ensure security order and handle pavement encroachment.

How new coronavirus restrictions in Paris and London will work
(CNN)Despite the US seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths, Dr. Anthony Fauci says that things would have to get "really, really bad" for him to advocate for a national lockdown.
The US is averaging more than 55,000 new cases a day -- up more than 60% since a mid-September dip -- and experts say the country is in the midst of the dreaded fall surge. On Friday, the US reported the most infections in a single day since July. As of Saturday, more than 8.1 million cases of the virus had been reported in the US and 219,666 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.
With all the previous and current measures to offset the spread of the virus, "the country is fatigued with restrictions," said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview on "60 Minutes" Sunday night.
"We want to use public health measures not to get in the way of opening the economy, but to being a safe gateway to opening the economy," Fauci told CBS News Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jonathan LaPook during the interview.
"So instead of having an opposition, open up the economy, get jobs back, or shut down. No, put shut down away and say 'we're going to use public health measures to help us safely get to where we want to go.' "
He added that it's not safe yet to say the country is "on the road to essentially getting out of this."
There is nearly no place in America where Covid-19 case counts are trending in the right direction as the country heads into what health experts say will be the most challenging months of the pandemic.
Only Missouri and Vermont recorded a more than 10% improvement in the average number of reported cases over the past week, according to the university's data. Cases in Connecticut and Florida, on the other hand, increased by 50% or more.
Twenty-seven states saw spikes between 10% and 50%: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
New cases are static in the remaining states.
"This really is a harrowing time, and people have to be careful," epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said.
'This surge has the potential to be way worse'
On Friday, 10 states reported their highest one-day counts: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, according to Johns Hopkins.
As infections rise, so, too, have hospitalizations. In New Mexico, hospitalizations have increased 101% this month, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said.
More hospitalizations will likely be followed by a rise in daily coronavirus deaths, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.
Though the average of 700 coronavirus deaths a day the US remains lower than the daily tolls of 1,000 in July and August, University of Washington researchers project more than 2,300 Americans could die daily by mid-January.
"When we saw this kind of transmission earlier on in the pandemic, in March and April, the virus hadn't seeded everywhere. ... This surge has the potential to be way worse than it was than either the spring or the summer," El-Sayed, Detroit's former health director, said.
State leaders push new restrictions
Americans can help get the virus under control, experts say, by heeding guidelines touted by officials for months: avoiding crowded settings, keeping a distance, keeping small gatherings outdoors and wearing a mask.
"This is a good moment for people to stop and ask themselves: 'What can I do to try to be sure that we limit the further infections that otherwise seem to be looming in front of us as cold weather is kicking in and people are indoors, and those curves are going upward, in the wrong direction?'" Collins said Friday.
The upticks have prompted state leaders to push new restrictions, including mask enforcement and limits on gatherings, in hopes of curbing the spread.
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts announced changes to the state's health measures, including requiring hospitals to reserve at least 10% of staffed general and ICU beds for Covid-19 patients.
In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said this month he instructed authorities to step up mask enforcement, and in New Mexico, the governor this week ordered new mass gathering limitations and a 10 p.m. closing time for establishments serving alcohol.
"Every New Mexican can and must do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19 by staying home, limiting their interactions with others, and wearing their masks," Grisham tweeted.
Many countries in Europe are seeing another wave of coronavirus infections. Paris and other parts of France have introduced nightly curfews to curb the spread.
The daily tally of new cases surpassed 32,000 in France on Saturday. The central area of the capital is bustling with people.
But as the clock strikes 9 p.m., few people remain. The streets are nearly deserted.
In some areas hit hard by the virus, nightly curfews from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. will stay in place for at least four weeks.
One restaurant in central Paris has started offering dinner an hour earlier than usual. All the customers leave by 9.
The restaurant owner said, "The number of customers had finally started to recover in autumn, but now we get this shock. I think it is going to be a very difficult time for us and many other restaurants."
New cases are also rising again in other countries, shooting past levels seen during the spring.
In Italy, nearly 11,000 cases were confirmed on Saturday. It was single-day record. Germany and Poland also reported one-day records.
Belgium will implement a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. on Monday. All bars and restaurants must stay closed for four weeks.
The foreign ministers of Belgium and Austria have both tested positive for the virus.
They sat next to each other at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg earlier this month. But it's not confirmed that the two cases are related.
Virus Resurgence Sees World Central Bankers Stick to Gloomy Tone
Sign up here for our daily coronavirus newsletter on what you need to know, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis.
Global central bankers are under no illusion that they’re through the fallout from the coronavirus, issuing fresh warnings about new government restrictions, struggling recoveries and threats to jobs.
Monetary chiefs from the euro area, Japan and the U.K. were united in their concern about their economies in an online seminar hosted by the Group of 30. They all said risks to the outlook remain to the downside and signaled support is going to be needed for some time. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda even warned that his economy is at risk of a recession if things turn sour.
“Japan is likely to follow an improving trend. However, this outlook is highly uncertain,” he said. “If growth expectations drop and the financial system becomes unstable, the economy could fall into a full-fledged recession.”
2020 GDP Forecast
While the situation across advanced economies is shaky, Europe’s outlook has been particularly dented by new curbs imposed to contain the spread of the virus. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that point head on, saying the measures could further hinder a recovery that’s already started to fade.
“The recovery in the euro area remains uncertain, uneven and incomplete,” she told her colleagues. “The new coronavirus-related restrictions currently being introduced across Europe will add to uncertainty for firms and households.”
The measures announced last week include a French curfew in Paris and other cities, while outside the euro zone, the U.K. imposed new rules on gatherings. Italy, which hit a daily record of virus cases Sunday, may impose more curbs this week. Ireland is considering health authorities’ recommendation to move the nation to the tightest lockdown level.
Lagarde also discussed an additional worry, which is the dramatic destruction of work from the pandemic. She highlighted that the situation has been worsened because of the greater damage in “job rich” services, which account for almost 75% of employment in euro-area countries.
Compounding that, the services recovery will be slower because it doesn’t benefit like durable-goods manufacturing does from pent-up demand.
“The car that you did not buy in March you are going to buy in September,” she said. “But the vacation you could not take in March, you are not going to take in October.”
From the Bank of England, Governor Andrew Bailey echoed that tone, saying there’s an “unprecedented level of economic uncertainty,” noting in particular the recent resurgence of virus cases.
He said the risks remain “very heavily skewed toward the downside.”
“To borrow a phrase from sports, I’m afraid the hard yards in are still to come,” he said.
ECB’s Lagarde Says Virus Curbs Will Bolster Economic Uncertainty
Pandemic impact on services is of particular concern, she says.
Lagarde says recovery remains incomplete, uneven, uncertain.
New restrictions being rolled out across the euro area to curb the surge of infections will increase uncertainty for companies and families, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said.
The lop-sided impact that the pandemic has on services is particularly worrying as the sector accounts for 75% of employment in the 19-nation region, she said. That may slow the recovery and increase inequality.
“The recovery remains uncertain, uneven and incomplete,” Lagarde told a panel discussion with heads of central banks from the U.K., China and Japan. “It is clear that both fiscal support and monetary policy support have to remain in place for as long as necessary and ‘cliff effects’ must be avoided.”
The remarks underscore policy makers’ growing concern about the pace of recovery. Weaker spending on consumer goods in the summer months suggested that there isn’t much pent-up demand, meaning sales lost are unlikely to be made up at a later point.
Less than two weeks before the ECB’s next policy meeting, the outlook for the euro-area has been growing rapidly worse after countries imposed curfews and other restrictions to stop the spread of the virus.
While officials have reasons to delay a decision on increasing their 1.35 trillion euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program, Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said on Saturday new curbs put the recovery further from reach.
Covid Cases Extend ‘Troubling’ Surge, Signaling More Deaths
A medical staff member performs a Covid-19 test in Fargo, North Dakota.
The number of daily Covid-19 cases is continuing its steady climb as temperatures begin to dip across the U.S., students return to classrooms and more people stay indoors where the virus spreads easily.
While far fewer people are ending up hospitalized with the illness than during the pandemic’s surge in March and April, many more deaths are expected to be added to almost 218,000 already reported nationally as cases spike, experts said.
“If you take a look from 30,000 feet, most states have rising case numbers,” with no downward trends to be seen, said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. “That is troubling as winter approaches.”
Nationally, seven-day moving case averages have climbed to their highest in two months, while the number of currently hospitalized Covid-19 patients was the most since Aug. 27, according to Johns Hopkins University and Covid Tracking Project data.
The seven-day average of deaths due to Covid-19 is still at about a third of peak levels in April, but a decline that took place over recent weeks appears to have stopped. Reported deaths often lag behind other numbers by several weeks, said Schaffner, so those numbers will likely follow the rising number of cases and hospitalizations.
Rural Surges
“All of us anticipate Covid is going to increase this winter,” he said.
Hopes that warm summer weather might tamp down spread were frustrated by outbreaks in Sun Belt states. Since then, there’s been a surge of cases in the Upper Midwest and on college campuses across the country. The highest case rates per capita in the past seven days have been in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wisconsin and Utah. South Dakota leads the nation in Covid-19 hospitalizations per capita.
Those trends, and similar increases across Europe, are cause for alarm, said New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio.
“It’s absolutely troubling to see how far these places are falling backwards,” he said Friday in an appearance on WNYC radio. “We can’t allow that to happen here.”
While the initial surge of the virus hit densely populated urban areas, it’s now overwhelming rural regions, suburbs and small cities. Based on the seven-day rolling average of new cases, New Mexico, Missouri, South Dakota, Michigan and Illinois have seen the biggest increases in the past week, by percentage.
“Overall, it’s looking grim to see the infections on the rise and the hospitalizations tracking with that,” said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Research Institute in La Jolla, California.
Daily Cases Per 100,000 by Urban-Rural Classification
The growing number of daily cases is a key indicator of the virus’s nationwide spread. With holiday socializing, influenza and winter weather all on the horizon, the increased number of hospitalizations is also cause for concern that the health-care system may soon be overwhelmed once again in certain areas.
Indeed, hospitals in the Upper Midwest hot spots are reporting their resources stretched and having to send patients to hospitals hours away or even in other states. With the pathogen now more entrenched in the population, winter’s surge could be worse than the first.
“We are arriving at the Covid-19 perfect storm,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The current increases are only the start of a long winter ahead, he said.
Improved Treatment
One bright spot, Osterholm said, is that hospitals have become far more adept and have more tools available to treat the virus. Medicines like Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, both given to President Donald Trump after he was diagnosed, are helping people recover.
Increased testing is also catching more cases early. The Trump administration announced last month that it would distribute 150 million rapid tests made by Abbott Laboratories for use in nursing homes, schools, and hard-hit minority populations.
U.S. Current Covid-19 Hospitalizations
Diagnostics manufacturers are now shipping more than 1.4 million tests nationwide each day, up from 600,000 at the start of May, according to AdvaMed, a trade group for the medical-technology industry. Total shipments have surpassed 190 million tests.
But even states that not long ago appeared to be doing well have seen resurgences. In New York City, schools shuttered in several neighborhoods shortly after reopening after a spike in cases in those areas.
“We’re just getting started,” said Osterholm, “And how bad it’s going to be is dependent on how the population responds. Right now, up to a third of the public doesn’t believe this is real; they believe it’s a hoax.”
Coronavirus vaccine: Is Chilean tree bark a key ingredient?
The quillaja tree, which grows in the Chilean Andes, has traditionally been used by the Mapuche to treat colds and inflammation. But it could play a significant role in a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.
    The Chilean biotech company Desert King is a significant actor in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The firm has developed a procedure that allows for active agents to be extracted from the bark and wood of the quillaja tree, which only grows in Chile. Desert King sells the resulting powder to a British subsidiary of the US vaccine development company Novovax.
Novovax announced in late September that it had initiated its first Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of its vaccine in the UK, and that it aimed to enroll 10,000 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 84 to take part. Currently, there are 11 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the third phase of testing.
Desert King General Manager Andres Gonzales told DW that if all went well, production of the vaccine could start early next year.
Multipurpose foaming agents
"A vaccine is comprised of two elements, an antigen and an adjuvant," explained Gonzalez. "The antigen activates a body's own defense, while the adjuvant helps release the antigen into the cells and also stimulates the body's immune response."
The quillaja tree, also known as the soap bark tree, has a high content of saponins, which are natural emulsifiers and multipurpose foaming agents. They can be used to bind substances that usually do not mix, such as water and oil, but they can also serve as adjuvants.
After conducting studies into the 50 odd saponins contained in the quillaja tree, Desert King identified two substances — QS7 and QS21 — that could function as an adjuvant in a potential vaccine.
"We are already producing industrial quantities of quillaja for Novavax," said Gonzalez.
The quillaja tree can grow up to 20 meters (65 feet) high; its trunk can reach a diameter of 1.5 meters. It flowers from October to January, producing an aromatic honey. The evergreen, with smooth and leathery leaves, has small, yellowish-white star-formed blossoms. With its five follicles, the woody fruit of the tree resembles star anise.
Used in traditional Mapuche medicine
The Mapuche, the largest indigenous group in Chile today, have long known about the healing properties of the quillaja tree. In their traditional medicine, they use the bark extract as a decongestant and also to treat digestive problems. They also make a tincture from the flowers to treat the symptoms of rheumatism.
Quillaja can also be used to make a natural shampoo and the food industry uses it in beer production, for example.
Hit by climate change
Unfortunately, the quillaja tree, which is generally adaptable, undemanding and can grow on barren land and mountain slopes, is suffering from the consequences of climate change, said Rene Carmona of the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Nature Conservation at the University of Chile in Santiago. "The droughts that Chile has been experiencing for 10 years have caused damage to the trees on slopes in particular."
Gonzalez of Desert King said that the producers of quillaja saponins in Chile were keen to work sustainably. He added that trees would be pruned rather than cut down, "This ensures that the trees have less biomass and need less water so that they can better cope with drought."
But Carmona said another major problem was that the tree was often cut down for its wood. He hoped that its use by pharmaceuticals could help raise awareness about the importance of protecting the quillaja trees.
"The fact that an international pharmaceutical company is using this substance to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 will help us to promote the tree's importance to people," Carmona said. "We hope that people will stop using the tree for firewood."
German glassmaker holds key to COVID-19 vaccine supply
As the world waits anxiously for a COVID-19 vaccine, a German company is doing its bit to ensure that the shot reaches you with its potency intact. Ashutosh Pandey reports from its Mainz headquarters.
    It's lunchtime at Schott's sprawling campus in Mainz, home to the glassmaker's headquarters and pharma glass-tubing production unit. The canteen is buzzing with employees, many of them relishing the meal … as well as some sun; on-site dining made a comeback just a few weeks back after being stopped at the height of the pandemic.
A towering red chimney of one of the plants overlooks the outdoor dining area, where the tables are evenly spaced out in line with social distancing norms. All tables are occupied, but conspicuous by their absence are the tubing plant staff, otherwise difficult to miss in their blue uniforms. I am told that's because the lunch hours have been divided into slots to check the spread of the coronavirus by minimizing contact between one set of employees and the other.
The strategy, along with other safety measures like a ban on visitors entering the production plants, seems to have worked so far. Schott has managed to keep production running at its facility without any disruptions, even when the virus was wreaking havoc in the region in spring.
The critical pharma tubing plant produces one-and-a-half meter-long glass tubes, which are used to make pharma vials at the company's plant in Müllheim, a small town about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Mainz in one of Germany's most industrialized states of Baden-Württemberg.
The 130-year-old firm, whose glass is used in products ranging from cooking tops to telescopes, has committed to supply enough vials to hold up to 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
Schott, which has already supplied millions of vials to COVID-19 vaccine makers, says it's well-placed to boost capacity at its production facilities, including in the US and Germany, to produce vials for another 1 billion doses. It is estimated that the world would need some 15 billion doses, assuming the successful vaccine is a twin-dose vaccine.
"We have a one-time chance to be part of the solution. We know that there are hundreds of vaccines being currently developed and we know that all those vaccines will need the packaging and Schott is prepared to provide that packaging," said Fabian Stöcker, head of Strategy and Innovation at Schott's pharma unit. "It's very motivating and a good feeling to be a part of efforts to get rid of this pandemic."
Governments, firms, and international organizations across the globe are spending billions of dollars to launch mass production of yet-to-be-approved vaccines and to boost supply chain capabilities, making sure they are not caught off guard once the vaccines are given the green light.
Who will get the coronavirus vaccine first?
Schott, which isowned by the Carl Zeiss Foundation — the owner of the eponymous lens maker, is using borosilicate glass to make the vials. The glass, invented by Schott founder Otto Schott, is often referred to as the gold standard for drug packaging, thanks to its extreme resistance to heat and chemicals and its inertness and density.
The glass is made using sand, chemicals, including sodium oxide and boric oxide, and crushed, recycled borosilicate glass, which is usually a leftover from the glass-making process. The mixture is then put in a furnace, which burns at around 1,550 degrees Celsius. Inside the furnace, known as a tubing tank, there are three chambers and several burners, which melt the mixture. All impurities are removed using chlorine gas before the liquid glass is drawn into tubes by robots.
The company says borosilicate glass is best suited for potential COVID-19 vaccines, as it avoids the interactions between containers and vaccines that can hurt the shot's potency.
Schott has struck deals with several leading vaccine makers, including India's Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine maker by volume, and partners of Operation Warp Speed — a public-private partnership initiated by the Trump administration to accelerate vaccine development.
The company is supplying vials to three out of four of all COVID-19 vaccine candidates in Phase I, II, or III, Stöcker said, adding that Schott was in talks with the other pharma companies to ascertain the size of the vials needed.
"At this point in time, it is not fully clear what kind of packaging would be needed. It is clear we would need a glass vial, but in some cases it's not clear what format would it be. Is it going to be a two-milliliter format or a 10-milliliter format? That would depend on how the vaccine is going to be administered later. Will it be a single shot or a multiple-dose vaccine," Stöcker told DW.   
The company is benefiting from its $1 billion expansion plan launched last year as it looks to meet the increasing demand for glass vials. It plans to spend half that amount by the end of next year. The company is also pumping in additional cash on new production lines. 
A united front against COVID-19
Schott's rivals, Gerresheimer and Stevanato Group, are also investing in boosting their capabilities. The three glassmakers produce billions of borosilicate glass vials every year — the type that would be needed for COVID-19 vaccines. 
"The virus is not holding back at the German border, nor at the US or the Chinese or Indian border," Stöcker told DW. "People realize that it's a global problem and that we need a global answer to it. That has driven all the players in the industry to work together, putting their competitive thinking a little bit aside."
Coronavirus vaccine producers pledge to follow normal rules, as one key trial is paused
German vaccine maker BioNTech and eight biotech companies have vowed to follow safety measures before rolling out vaccines. AstraZeneca has suspended one trial after "a potentially unexplained illness" in a participant.
Several companies developing vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday pledged to "uphold the integrity of the scientific process" amid growing concerns they could succumb to political pressure.
"We, the undersigned biopharmaceutical companies, want to make clear our ongoing commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles," said the chief executives of AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna, among others.
Public health authorities have touted a successful vaccine as the only remedy to the deadly pathogen, which has infected 28 million people and left nearly one million others dead across the globe.
The companies said they would only seek emergency authorizations for their vaccines "after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities."
Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administrator (FDA) approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and blood plasma to treat coronavirus patients, triggering a backlash from experts who argued there was not sufficient scientific evidence to prove their safe efficacy. The FDA reversed these decisions shortly after.
The race for a vaccine
Oxford/AstraZeneca trial on hold
AstraZeneca, one of the co-signers of the open pledge, told a US outlet that trials of their vaccine candidate were temporarily suspended after a patient fell seriously ill.
Dubbed the Oxford vaccine, AstraZeneca's AZD1222 went into Phase 3 clinical trials — considered the last step before regulatory approval — in the UK, US and Brazil late last month.
"As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process was triggered and we voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee," an AstraZeneca spokesperson told health news website STAT.
"This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials."
Brazil's health authority said later on Tuesday that AstraZeneca had halted the clinical trial and that it was waiting for more information on why, seemingly corroborating the report in STAT.
Making sense of coronavirus infection statistics
At the start of the pandemic, most people focused on the coronavirus reproduction value to assess the severity of the outbreak. Now, the COVID-19 incidence rate is at the center of attention. What do the two terms mean?
Until recently, the greatest concern of health authorities was to keep the reproduction number, or R-value, for the coronavirus below the critical threshold of 1.
If the R-value rises above 1, this indicates that — statistically speaking — one infected person infects more than one other person. Infection rates will thus rise. If, however, the R-value falls below 1, this indicates that one infected person will — statistically speaking — infect fewer than one person. To contain a virus outbreak, therefore, the R-value must be kept below 1.
On Tuesday, Germany’s public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said the country’s seven-day R-value was at 1.2. But fewer people are focusing on this indicator than in previous weeks and months.
Coronavirus incidence
Lately, many decision-makers and ordinary people seem to be paying more attention to the cumulative number of coronavirus infections and illnesses over a certain time period. This so-called incidence is an indicator of the risk that people will contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus within a certain time frame.
Germany’s seven-day incidence rate shows the number of new coronavirus infections — according to positive PCT and antigen tests — within the past week per 100,000 inhabitants.
If too many individuals become infected, Germany’s regions are urged to impose respective security measures. These may include making masks mandatory everywhere, introducing curfews, banning the sale of alcohol, limiting the number of people allowed to gather in private and at public events, restricting travel and refusing to let tourists from high-risk regions stay in the area's hotels.
Germany extends list of cities under coronavirus clampdown
Munich became the latest major city to exceed Germany’s key coronavirus threshold. In the capital Berlin, authorities have implemented a nighttime curfew — the first in 70 years — in response to a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases. All Berlin businesses are required to close by 11 p.m. at least until the end of October. The number of people allowed to meet outside at night is limited to five.
What is a sensible threshold?
Most regions and federal states in Germany have determined that 50 new coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants signal a serious danger. The southern state of Bavaria has introduced an early warning system: If 35 or more cases are reported within a certain part of Bavaria, regional public health agencies must inform the state's Health Ministry about the cause of the spike and which countermeasures are being taken.
The latest coronavirus figures in Germany can be viewed on the RKI's website.
The 50-case threshold, which is arbitrary but not completely without foundation, was set in May to define a critical infection rate.
"This is when public health departments become so strained that they can no longer trace every infection to find out who became infected before," Frank Ulrich Montgomery, who heads the World Medical Association (WMA), told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. Once this threshold is exceeded, action must be taken, he said. This, he said, is not being alarmist but "a sensible thing to do from a public health perspective."
The RKI also says this 50-case threshold is key. On its website, the agency states that "the absolute number of new infections must be low enough to allow for effective contact tracing to happen and to keep the strain on intensive care units (ICU) manageable."
New EU traffic light system to provide orientation for tourist travel
Do more tests mean more positive results?
However, Stefan Willich, who heads the Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics at Berlin’s Charite hospital, says the 50-person threshold is out of date. Speaking to public broadcaster RBB Inforadio, Willich said a "sensible reference" was needed to make statistical sense of the coronavirus pandemic. He said the 50-person mark per week per 100,000 inhabitants "seemed like a precise indicator" five months ago, but that in reality, it was little more than a rough indication.
Willich said many more people are now undergoing coronavirus tests than in spring, meaning that the sheer number of tests will increase the likeliness of higher recorded infection rates. Consequently, he said, "we are lacking a proper frame of reference."
Willich recommends basing our assessment of the extent of the pandemic on representative samples. "I think we will come to a different definition over the coming weeks on the basis of new samples and surveys."
The epidemiologist says he is certain that safety measures such as masks, social distancing and contact tracing will have to remain in place for quite a while longer.
"These measures are the pillars of our long-term strategy," says Willich, adding that if we practice them, the pandemic will be manageable. He also says high-risk individuals in retirement and nursing homes, as well as hospitals, must be placed under special protection.
Constant updating needed
Andreas Gassen, who heads the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, is critical of the 50-person threshold, too. He told the German daily Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung we should stop focusing on this indicator, as it sparks "alarmism."  
"Even 10,000 infections per day would not be dramatic, provided only one out of 1,000 people fall gravely ill — which is what we are seeing now," he said.
Gassen's comments came in response to warnings by Robert Koch Institute director Lothar Wieler, who recently said Germany could lose control of the outbreak. Gassen pointed out that in spring this year, Germany recorded some 4,000 new infections and up to 150 deaths per day.
"That is over, and now we are seeing a single-digit death toll," Gassen said. He said that if this ratio remained stable, Germany could cope even with five-figure infection rates. Gassen does not, therefore, expect the country’s health care system will collapse in autumn and winter.
Frank Ulrich Montgomery of the WMA has disagreed. "It takes between four and six weeks before someone dies from a coronavirus illness," he said. This means, he argued, that recently detected infections only provided a snapshot of the situation a week before. A growing number of cases ending in death were to be expected in ICUs only in four to five weeks' time.  "That is why I think it is too early to make such a statement," he said.
A realistic indicator?
Gassen, meanwhile, recommends analyzing which age brackets are becoming infected. "I think we can allow for a sense of normality to return, provided we communicate sensibly." He says that if infections spike, quick action could be taken once more.
Therefore he recommends raising the 50-person threshold per 100,000 inhabitants, which is currently used to classify German regions and cities as coronavirus hotspots. Gassen says this threshold was defined during a time when some 400,000 coronavirus tests were being carried out per week, which produced many positive results. Now, however, testing has been ramped up to three times this number and many results are coming back negative, he says.
Gassen says a new threshold should take into consideration the significant rate of negative test results we are seeing today. He says based on the current situation, a rate of 84 infections per 100,000 would be a suitable indicator. But he is of the opinion that the number is unsuitable anyway as a rigid and sole indicator when it comes to imposing radical public health measures.
'COVID fatigue' grips Europe as virus spreads
Assessing travel risks
Germany also applies the 50-person threshold to determine whether foreign regions classify as coronavirus hotspots. The decision is made based on an analysis by the Health Ministry, Foreign Ministry, and Interior Ministry.
In a first step, the ministries assess which foreign regions or countries recorded 50 or more coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the last seven days. Then, in a second step, German authorities check whether regions with lower infection rates could also pose a danger. The updated German list of designated international risk areas can be viewed here (in German).
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, for its part, displays a 14-day-incidence figure on its website. But the agency warns against comparing coronavirus infection rates across different EU states, as this data is generated using a variety of different methodologies. Some countries are mass-testing citizens, while others are not, the agency says. This, of course, has an impact on recorded coronavirus cases.
Am I immune to COVID-19?
Traffic-light warning system
In an effort to create more transparency, the EU has introduced a traffic light system to highlight high-risk zones in the bloc. Regions with a lack of data are marked grey.
Red zones denote regions that either recorded 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and a test positivity of over 4%, or that recorded 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past two weeks.
The warning system is based on the rate of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 14 days, and the percentage of positive tests.
